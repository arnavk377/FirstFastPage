    "How would you sort this list with... \n",
    "- Bubble Sort\n",
    "    - Bubble sort works by switching elements of a list which are right next to each other. It starts with the first two indices and then keeps on moving up until the last index of the list is the greatest. This repeats until the entire list is sorted. In this case, 75 and 17 are first compared and swaps the position of 17 and 75. The list keeps on moving with 75, until a greater value is found, swapping the larger value index number with the smaller number index number. This steps repeats until the list is in order.\n",
    "- Selection Sort\n",
    "    - In selection sort, the first value is set to be the smallest value. The algorithm goes through the entire list and checks for the smallest value. If one is found, it is set as the minimum value and the index numbers are swapped, putting the smallest one at index 1. The list keeps on repeating for every index, finding where each element would go. This list would set 75 as the minimum value and then check for the smallest one in the list, which would be 0, repeating until the list is in order.\n",

    "[88, 39, 53, 39, 58, 43, 74, 81, 71, 51]\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you sort this list with... \n",
    "- Merge Sort\n",
    "    - Merge sort works by splitting the list into shorter lists and sorting these shorter lists and then merging together and sorting the final list. First of all, the list is divided into smaller lists until the sublist has 1 or fewer elements in it. Then for each sublist, the elements are sorted. Finally, the smaller lists are merged and sorted finally to produce the original list in a sorted form. For this example, the list would first be split into parts of [88, 39, 53, 39, 58] and [43, 74, 81, 71, 51], then split up some more until there is one index or less in the sublists. Then, these sublists are sorted and then merged to get the final sorted list.\n",
    "- Insertion Sort\n",
    "    - The insertion sort checks a sorted part of a list with an unsorted element and then inserts the element in the correct place. Insertion sort first assumes that the first element of the list is sorted and then checks the following element to add to the \"sorted\" list. For this case, it would start at 88 and assume 88 is sorted and then check whether 39 should go after or before 39. This keeps on repeating until the entire list is sorted.\n",

    "        - This code is pass-by-reference. This is because the bubble sort algorithm will alter the actual list, thanks to the swap code. This is seen by the output as the original list is changed based on the key sorted by, and the sorted list is not separate from the original list.\n",
