    "# KASM Information\n",
    "\n",
    "KASM is relatively simple to install for such a powerful software. It allows us to use Docker based containers to complete actions on numerous platforms, from browsing the web on Chrome to running code on VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "KASM allows anonymous containers to be accessed from any computer, which will be useful in allowing school chromebooks to run coding applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "KASM is also highly customizable because of its usage of Docker containers. Docker containers can be used to run various applications if a user has created a container. Additionally, KASM can be integrated into browsers to safely open links and webistes. After a user is done with a running container, it will be stopped and there will be no evidence on the web that the container was ever open."
