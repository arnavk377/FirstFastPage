I also used algorithms to manipulate lists in certain ways. It is important to check the values of indices for certain programs. Indices are very important in lists because they have the value of where each data point is located. . Quiz . I scored an 8/10 on the quiz. I got questions 7 and 9 wrong. . Question 7 . Link to Image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v6sMC8NobA_R4UbF3aJBKvRwTDdfT_xb/view?usp=sharing . Question: What is Base 0 Indexing? | Actual Answer: Seguence demarcated with an Index starting from 0 | . I originally answered a) Binary, thinking that this would refer to the 0s and 1s. This was a silly mistake, and I forgot that Binary conversions are done with base 2. When a list has an index of 0 for its first element, this would be Base 0 Indexing, since the first index is at 0. . Question 9 . Link to Image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zmxeXww2YxTBzhzHWRuU_J0pQXQYPBSj/view?usp=sharing . Question: I want to iterate over a list until the user inputs &#39;quit&#39;. What loop would I use? | Actual Answer: FOR loops | . My first answer was while loops because I thought it would make sense for the command to run while a certain condition is true, which would be if the user has not quit. FOR loops would work because it could include for every action, which could include opening an app, lowering the brightness, or shutting down the machine and quitting. . Reflection . I thought I did decently well on the quiz. It will be important to pay attention to what the question is asking for to prevent silly mistakes. I will also need to remember to think through problems, and go through each answer choice to find the best one. . Important Notes . Iteration can repeat something multiple times, either based on a condition or a set count | Lists methods Mutate, meaning they actively change the list, but they don&#39;t return anything. This means that return a None-type, which you cannot manipulate | Lists are collections of data, are iterable | Lists start at index 0 | Iterate through lists with for or while loops | . Vocab . Iteration - Repitition of a Process | For Loop - FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated | While Loop - The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met | Initialization - What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0. | Condition - Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop. | increment/decrement - Modifies the counter variable after each repetition. | Indexing / List Index - The position of an element in a list, starting from 0 | append, remove, pop - Various methods, append adds an element to the end, remove removes at an index, and pop removes the last item. | Elements [in a list] - An item in a list. | Nesting - Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops. | array - Another name for a list, depends on the language | .",

Question 4 . See image . Question 5 . To select the number 69, you must go through binary search. First, you must find the middle value by adding the first(1) and last index(8) value and dividing by 2. Since that value is a decimal(3.5), round up(4), and the element is 6. | This is not the intended value, so take each half of the list, before the middle and after the middle and repeat binary search. Repeating this process for the first half finds a middle value of that portion(1+4/2 = 2.5, round to index 3, whose element has a value of 3). For the back half of the list, we repeat this value, with the 6-8th elements, selecting index 7, which has a value of 11. | Since the value of 69 is not found, we must repeat the binary search process. Now, the back half only has the endpoints to be checked, indices 6 and 8. Index 6 is 9, which is not the intended value, but index 8 is the intended value of 69. | . Question 6 . See image . Question 7 . An order that can be used for binary search is: . [&quot;Market&quot;, &quot;Ralphs&quot;, &quot;store&quot;, &quot;Target&quot;, &quot;Walmart&quot;] This is because the strings are in alphabetical order, which would make sense. | . Question 8 . Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because binary search allows the computer to check exponentially more numbers each search. A binary search algorithm keeps on multiplying the amount of numbers checked by 2 each time. The sequential search checks each element individually, which will probably take a longer time, since the algorithm must go through every item of a list. . Question 9 . See image . To find the number 36, it would take 2 checks. The middle value on the first check would be 16, the 3rd index((1+5)/2). Then, we take the parts of the list on each side of the middle element. Before 16 are 64 and 36, while after 16 are 11 and 9. For the first part of the list there are 2 indices, 1 and 2. Using the binary search formula, (1+2)/2 = 1.5, which rounds up to the element at index 2, which is 36, the designated value. . def binary_search(list, value): bottom = 0 top = len(list) - 1 mid = 0 while bottom &lt;= top: mid = (bottom + top) // 2 if list[mid] &lt; value: bottom = mid + 1 elif list[mid] &gt; value: top = mid - 1 else: return mid return -1 numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] x = 4 test = binary_search(numbers, x) if test != -1: print(&quot;Element&quot;, str(x), &quot;is present at index&quot;, str(test)) else: print(&quot;Element is not present in array&quot;) .

Short Answer Questions . Using libraries allows users to access and reuse pre-written code. This allows algorithms to be made more efficient. Additionally, there are many libraries which are created for multiple different purposes, which makes it easier for programmers to create more complex algorithms. | First, the code segment imports the random library for use. Then, the program takes in names from user input, and puts them into a list(names). Then, the variable num_items finds the length of the list of names. The random_choice variable generates a random number which will be an index of the list. random_choice makes use of the random.randint function and generates a value from 0 to the maximum index(length of list minus 1). Then the program finds the person who is associated with the randomly generated value. Finally, the program prints that individual&#39;s name. | import random # takes user input, puts it into a list of names names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, seperated by a comma.&quot;) names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) num_items = len(names) # uses random to choose a random number random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) # associates random number with a name person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] # prints name print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) . Dwayne Johnson is going to buy the meal today! . Coding Challenge . Question 1 . import random names_list = [&quot;McCorkle&quot;, &quot;Patrick&quot;, &quot;Josh&quot;, &quot;Justin&quot;, &quot;Kyler&quot;, &quot;Jared&quot;, &quot;Derek&quot;, &quot;Jalen&quot;, &quot;Daniel&quot;, &quot;Taylor&quot;, &quot;Dak&quot;, &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Andy&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;Davis&quot;] random_list = [] def addPeople(list, new_list): count = 1 while count &lt;= 5: number = random.randint(0, len(list) - 1) new_list.append(list[number]) count += 1 return new_list print(addPeople(names_list, random_list)) . [&#39;Josh&#39;, &#39;Jared&#39;, &#39;McCorkle&#39;, &#39;Jalen&#39;, &#39;Dak&#39;] . Documentation . This program generates 5 random names from a list. A list of names is predefined, as well as another empty list for the names to be put into. The function addPeople is defined for the sequence of code. It establishes a counter variable, which allows for 5 names to be appended to using a while loop, as the program runs while the counter variable is under a certain value. A random number is generated using the random.randint function, which generates a random integer from 0 to 1 less than the length of the list. This makes sure that when it calls the index to append into the new list, the index values fall in the range of the list of full names. Finally, the program returns the new list. . Question 2 . import random score1 = 0 score2 = 0 def DiceGame(): score1 = random.randint(1, 6) + random.randint(1, 6) score2 = random.randint(1, 6) + random.randint(1, 6) if score1 &gt; score2: print(&quot;Player 1 won with a score of &quot; + str(score1) + &quot; points!&quot;) if score1 &lt; score2: print(&quot;Player 2 won with a score of &quot; + str(score2) + &quot; points!&quot;) if score1 == score2: print(&quot;Both players tied with &quot; + str(score1) + &quot; points!&quot;) DiceGame() DiceGame() . Player 1 won with a score of 8 points! Both players tied with 9 points! . Documentation . The function must import the random library in order to replicate rolling a pair of dice. 2 variables are defined at first. Then, a function is created to represent the dice game. To give each player a score, the random.randint function is called twice, adding both random numbers to each other and storing that value. The random.randint function runs from 1 to 6, which represents a dice rolling a number from 1 to 6 equally. This is repeated for both players. Then, the scores are compared. If both scores are equal, a message is printed stating there is a tie. If one player has more points than the other, a statement saying that player with more points won is printed. . Extra .

This lesson provided great insight into how to create procedures and make robots. Procedures are important in many coding languages, and having efficient names for them will be key, especially when there is a long program. Procedures also have arguments which allow different arguments to be called. Moving robots can be challenging, as it can be hard to visualize and describe the specific rotations it would take. The nature of direction makes it much easier for us to do, but very hard for us to describe and instruct upon. I had some challenges with the robot moving problems, but with lots of practice, I can achieve mastery. .",

I also used algorithms to manipulate lists in certain ways. It is important to check the values of indices for certain programs. Indices are very important in lists because they have the value of where each data point is located. . Quiz . I scored an 8/10 on the quiz. I got questions 7 and 9 wrong. . Question 7 . Link to Image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v6sMC8NobA_R4UbF3aJBKvRwTDdfT_xb/view?usp=sharing . Question: What is Base 0 Indexing? | Actual Answer: Seguence demarcated with an Index starting from 0 | . I originally answered a) Binary, thinking that this would refer to the 0s and 1s. This was a silly mistake, and I forgot that Binary conversions are done with base 2. When a list has an index of 0 for its first element, this would be Base 0 Indexing, since the first index is at 0. . Question 9 . Link to Image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zmxeXww2YxTBzhzHWRuU_J0pQXQYPBSj/view?usp=sharing . Question: I want to iterate over a list until the user inputs &#39;quit&#39;. What loop would I use? | Actual Answer: FOR loops | . My first answer was while loops because I thought it would make sense for the command to run while a certain condition is true, which would be if the user has not quit. FOR loops would work because it could include for every action, which could include opening an app, lowering the brightness, or shutting down the machine and quitting. . Reflection . I thought I did decently well on the quiz. It will be important to pay attention to what the question is asking for to prevent silly mistakes. I will also need to remember to think through problems, and go through each answer choice to find the best one. . Important Notes .

When naming a variable, it is important to make it simple and not too long, for ease of use and calling in a program. We can store different types of values in the variable, like an integer, string, boolean, or float. When calling variable, the value stored in the variable will be the same as the most recent definition of the variable above the call.

Skill 3.A - Generalize data sources through variables. Skill 3.C - Explain how abstraction manages complexity. Skill 4.A - Explain how a code segment or program functions. Skill 4.C - Identify and correct errors in algorithms and programs, including error discovery through testing. . Question 8 . My Answer: A Correct Answer: B . I thought that the index started at 0, and forgot that the code would not work if j or k were values greater than the length of numList. . Question 11 . My Answer: D Correct Answer: B . I did not pay enough attention to the question, and did not notice that the if statement iterates until k is greater than myList. This means that the function will check through all elements. . Question 14 . My Answer: A Correct Answer: B . If 7 is run through command, “check” will be displayed. However, 6 also displays “check”, which is incorrect. . Question 30 . My Answer: A Correct Answer: B . Using a list makes it easier to apply the same procedure to all the items in the list. . Question 39 . My Answer: A Correct Answer: B . Silly mistake, thought question was asking for potential item. . . Reflection . After taking this test, I now know have a better idea of what to focus on when taking multiple choice tests. I should pay a greater amount of attention when answering questions, and always be sure to read the question carefully. Doing this will be able to cut down on some mistakes. I also have to remember the exam will be in psuedo-code, so there may be terms which I need to familiarize myself with. Overall, my score was pretty good(45/50), but by paying more attention and brushing up on a few skills, I can reduce the number of errors which I make. .",

We observed a lot of different websites from both the AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A classes. For example, we saw an APCSA project which had a random song generator. We also saw an NBA statistics site, as well as a game of Hangman. . Animation . Looking through the 3D Animation class, we saw many interesting projects. They featured lots of donuts, but each student had their own distinct donut and background. It was really interesting. . . Art . Art is definitely something I struggle with, but I saw really cool art pieces at Night at the Museum. There were many different styles of art, and they all looked really good. . . Some were pencil drawings, some were colored pencil, and some were paintings. . . Ceramics . Ceramics had many cool products to show at Night at the Museum. While creating the art may have been frustrating, the finished projects are very nice showpieces. . . Project Ideas . Night at the Museum is a great place for creativity. There were many fantastic works which could be used as inspiration.

We can constantly move tasks based on their status in the project. . . . Wireframe . We also made wireframes using Canva to plan out our project and also design our website before actually making it. It helped prevent errors and problems by fixing and thinking everything through beforehand. We designed all our pages through the wireframme before coding for it in VSCode. . . Problems . We did run into a few problems while making our final project. . One of our problems was formatting the website’s background We had to make it so that the aspect ratio was applicable to any screen size | Some computers showed the background being cut off | . | Another problem we had was getting our API to work At first, we couldn’t extract the questions from our URL and we couldn’t access the JSON file | After we figured that out, we couldn’t figure out how to call the backend code for API in the frontend | . | . . Progress . We have made considerable progress in our final project. . This first screenshot shows the homepage for our final project website, named Practice Nexus. We have cards for our two quizzes, a math quiz and a geography quiz. The page is also designed with different colors and images, with a navigation bar to access different parts of the website. . . This second screenshot shows the about us page for our final project website. The page introduces all the team members with the following information: . Role - Scrum Master, Frontend, Backend, DevOps | Age/Grade | Favorite things to do | Link to fastpages | . . This final screenshot shows us implementing the API we selected. We are able to get the question, and 4 answer choices from the json file. We still need to work on a way for the user to see if they are correct or not . . We stil have to finish up some designing. Once we do that, we also have to design each individual quiz page so that one question pops up at a time and answer choices can be selected. We might also include a scoring page, where we keep track of how many questions the user got right/wrong. . We plan to finish this by our design by splitting up the work while also keeping track of everyone else’s work and posting any problems/issues. Backend developers - Tay and Luke - will work on coding for scores and also make/use API to get the questions into the Frontend | Frontend developers - Adi and I - will implement the API and use it to get questions into the quiz pages.

Our program will be a notes site which allows users to store their notes for classes. | We plan to store the notes so a user can make specific folders for certain classes. | Also, we want the user to access the notes, even after closing the site. | . Plan . Develop each aspect of code -&gt; Run the code -&gt; Optimize code -&gt; Add to big project . How we could approach development: . Develop a way for users to input questions and answers | Develop a way for users to store the flashcards as a named set | Create a way for users to access cards. | Develop a way for users to place flashcard sets in a folder | Create a way for users to access cards. | Develop a login system. | Create example sets. | Program Info . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of the program is to randomly generate questions based on a user’s notes of key terms/dates/ideas and definitions. The program will take the user’s notes and, based on it, select the key terms and output multiple quiz questions which will be displayed randomly. It will score the quiz and tell you what you got wrong and what you need to study on. | . Data Abstraction . The program will contain lists and dictionaries. Every key term will have a definition and these will be stored in a dictionary which will be stored in a list. Or they will be stored in a local database and we will use the objects in the database to create the quiz. | . Managing Complexity . The dictionaries and databases will manage the complexity of the program by organizing the data inputted by the user. It will also help calling back to create the quiz. | . Procedural Abstraction . A function will be created to call back to the data inputted by the user. The function will iterate over the dictionary/database and use the values in them as a parameter to make a quiz. | . Algorithm Implementation . Like stated before, the program will contain a function that uses iteration and sequencing to make a quiz based off the data inputted by the user that is saved in a database or dictionary. | . Testing . The function will be called each time the user inputs a note and each time the user generates a quiz. When the user inputs a note, the function is called and saves the note inside a dictionary or database. When the user presses the button that generates the quiz, the function is again called and iterates through the user’s notes to generate a quiz that is related to the key terms the user inputted. | . How it aligns with Standards . Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online data system, a file Our project will take in user input and be able to save data for specific users. | . | Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the program’s purpose We will store question and answer sets in either lists or dictionaries. | . | At least one procedure that contributes to the program’s intended purpose, where you have defined: the procedure’s name, the return type, one or more parameters We will be able to return question and answer sets and store them under a name. | . | An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure We will have to create a random selection algorithm for our | . | Calls to your student-developed procedure The program will feature unique student created procedure to call back to. | . | Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and program functionality The outputs could have correct and incorrect screen for the user. | . |",

Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. . In the Nighthawk Coders APCSP you can find an Overview and Examples using APIs:APCSP APIs menu- Using Covid RapidAPI JavaScript frontend API code in APCSP Fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-rapidapi.md | . | Making a Jokes API (this will next API tech talk) Frontend.

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",

FYI, related tests could be in same Issue by using markdown checkboxes to separate tests. | . | . Hacks . Some errors which may arise in our project could be how we would store user inputs for a certain user. Storing this could be a challenge, so we would probably need to test that out. | Some test cases could be testing user input and how the user would be displayed. We could test user storage by listing out a list of users. We could also test storing of questions and answers. We could do this by having a page which shows the list of questions and answers a user has. | We can document bugs on the scrumboard and how we solved the problem. | Single tests will be very useful for testing small features. We can use this as we add pieces of the program together, and then get a large, successful project. | Things we can use single tests for: storing user input, repeating code segments which loop, and deploying the site. | .

PBL - Project Based Learning is an inquiry-based instructional approach, in a real-world context, where students generate the pathways and products that meet defined, standards-based outcomes | Project - Time frame in which your culminating product is developed through workshops and deliverables | Culminating Project - Compilation of deliverables derived from the Deconstructed TEKS that come together to create a final presentation/demonstration of what was learned throughout the project | Driving Questions - Helps to initiate and focus the inquiry. It also captures and communicates the purpose of the project in a succinct question. It creates interest and a feeling of challenge. It guides the project work. It helps student answer the question: “Why are we doing this?” | Enduring Understanding - Refers to the important ideas or CORE processes that are central to a discipline and transferable to new situations and that have lasting value BEYOND the classroom… Learning should be measured in YEARS. “30 hours vs. 30 days vs. 30 years” | Entry Launch - The engaging activity that kickstarts your PBL. | Entry Document - The document used to drive the project, connect the TEKS to the idea, and develop the KNOW/K2K. Can be delivered in multiple formats. | Checkpoints - Scheduled mini-presentations held throughout the project to allow for formative assessment, positive &amp; negative feedback, whole group collaboration, accountability, speaking practice, and progression toward project completion. These develop 21st Century Skills and reinforce the focus on the enduring understanding, driving question, and culminating product. | Facilitating Questions - Appropriate way that teachers use to guide students toward the enduring understanding/deliverable/goal, redirect students, “pull out” content vocabulary, or help students make connections (conceptual, cross-discipline, relevance, value). Open ended is most effective, but close ended, probing techniques are acceptable for scaffolding. | Workshops - Planned lessons that are listed for students in a checklist or added assessments indicate. Commonly held in small groups to meet the need of the student(s) or group(s). | Deliverable - “End result” or goal of a workshop that will directly be used for the realization of the culminating product. It can be knowledge, but it is typically something that will be presented, built upon, or used to achieve the project’s desired result. | .",

Sleep by 11:00 everyday | Practice my instrument for at least 30 minutes each day | Work on college applications for at least 30 minutes each day | Minimize homework on the weekend(less specific) | . Goals can help us feel more organized, even we have a lot on our plate. This will help reduce stress levels in us. Especially with college application season, I think creating a list of small and specific goals related to applications will allow me to be less stressed, feel more in control, and be happier. .",

We will create an introduction page, and have a 3 quesiton quiz. The intro page will have a button which allows the user to go to the next question, as well as an image related to the quiz. . We plan to have our quiz be about Del Norte High School, so it could provide some uses to Del Norte students. Potential topics for quiz questions could be: . What is our mascot? | What classes are offered at DNHS? | Who is our principal? | What time does school start? | What time does school end? | When are late start days? | . Each question will have 4 answer choices, with an image or button corresponding to answer choices. If the user clicks on the button corresponding to the right answer, they will be taken to a “correct screen.” If the user gets the question wrong(clicks on an incorrect answer choice), they will be taken to an “incorrect page.” . On each “correct screen”, we plan to have an image which showcases an image of validation, and a button for the next question. On each “incorrect page”, we would have the opposite of the “correct screen”, but still a button for the next question. . After the user answers all the questions, we will take them to a final screen, which could show their score or take them to the beginning of the quiz if they want to retake it. . Plan of Screens: Home Screen -&gt; Question 1 Screen -&gt; Correct/Wrong Screen -&gt; Question 2 Screen -&gt; Correct/Wrong Screen -&gt; Question 3 Screen -&gt; Correct/Wrong Screen -&gt; Final Screen . Our Code . We utilized a lot of onEvent statements in our code, as they would let us know if a specific button has been clicked. . . Additionally, to get a score, we defined a variable and added to it every time the user selected a correct answer. . We created a variable results box, which is varied due to the display of the score. We did this since each user would have a different score. . . The playSound button adds a fun little twist, as it plays custom audio to the user after completion of the quiz. . We often looked at the code in the text form to help us build familiarity with Javascript. The debug console also helped us a lot in figuring out our mistakes, and we will use it a lot in future projects. We wonder if the debug console can be used in other languages, like Python. . The Quiz. . Here is the link to our quiz. . Our Experience . Successes, Discoveries, and Challenges . We created a quiz which was able to track the score of the user. We had some challenges defining a variable to store the score, since the syntax is different from python. We realized that we had to define the variable, and then add to it using different syntax. This is different from python because python allows the coder to keep on redefining a variable. . We also had some trouble with formatting, and centering the images and items on the screen. We learned about the pixel dimensions of the screen(it is 320 x 450 px!) We then had to use dimensions of other items on the screen to help us center the images. It was also interesting to see how the positioning system works. . What We Learned . Using AppLab was a very cool experience. It really helped us learn more about Javascript, with an easy to use interface. We liked using the blocks, but the ability to check out the code in true Javascript helped us see basic Javascript programming. This project helped us learn about user interaction and how Javascript is a powerful language for that. . We also got a preview of how to use images in Javascript. We saw the positioning system, but there still a lot to learn about how to call the shapes in real code. . Extra Project . We decided to test out other features in App Lab. We did this by creating a simple game of tic tac toe. We learned about defining variables, altering images, and even adding sound! The program allows two users to play a game of tic tac toe, and allows the user the option to reset the scoreboard without restarting the app. We also continued practicing Javascript, and using the debug console as a way to help us see where our code was going wrong.

The boxes which are around the articles seem to not have been there(with minima), and I don’t know if that was supposed to happen when changing the theme to Merlot. The preview images were very large, instead of the small ones which minima has. Also, the GitHub user button did not seem to work. It can be seen that minima is the optimized theme for Fastpages. . Customizing the Fastpage Site . I experimented with dark mode on the site, as well as changing the color of dark mode from black to a different color. It is a neat way to customize the site, but I think I will stick with the regular dark mode for now. . . Time Box Fragments . I have created a time box on the frontpage describing what I have done for the week, and linked the review ticket. . Naming and Tagging . Naming and tagging are very useful on the blog to organize material. Using the tagging feature, I have been able to organize my posts and notebooks based on the language, the subject they are for, and they week they were posted. . . Using the Searchbar . The search bar is also a powerful tool for this blog. It helps to find posts with keywords, but it also finds posts with certain tags. In the image, I was easily able to search for posts with the “week0” tag. . . Changing _config.yml . I had originally changed the config file to show the preview images, which the site did not do before. I changed show_image: to true and this allows for a different, more interesting format. . Using Liquid . I learned that liquid could make creating the time box easier. Liquid has the capability of “incrememnting” variables, or adding one each time the variable is called.

[{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;John&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Mortensen&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;October 21&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;jmortensen@powayusd.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;2015-Fusion&#39;, &#39;2011-Ranger&#39;, &#39;2003-Excursion&#39;, &#39;1997-F350&#39;, &#39;1969-Cadillac&#39;]}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Sunny&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Naidu&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;August 2&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;Temecula&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;snaidu@powayusd.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;4Runner&#39;]}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Arnav&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Kanekar&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;July 3&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;**********@*****.***&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: &#39;None&#39;}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;John&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Cena&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;April 23&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;Tampa&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;johncena@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: &#39;2006 Ford GT, 1970 Plymouth Superbird&#39;}] . For Loops . Using a for loop to iterate through a list. . sports = [&quot;football&quot;, &quot;track&quot;, &quot;soccer&quot;, &quot;basketball&quot;, &quot;tennis&quot;] # list # iterates based on the range, so in this case it will only iterate 5 times for i in range(5): print(sports[i]) # would not print more than 5 sports, even if list is longer . football track soccer basketball tennis . For Loop with an Index . Creating a list and using a for loop with indexes to print it. This iterates for every index in the list, making it more powerful and easier to code with. . cake_flavors = [&quot;chocolate&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;vanilla&quot;] # List # For loop, for index in list for i in cake_flavors: print(i) # Print the flavor . chocolate strawberry vanilla . Using the While Loop and Inputs . This demonstrates usage of the while loop. The while loop calls a function as long as a certain condition is met. This is also another example of creating dictionaries using inputs. . meals = {} # empty dictionary length = 4 # runs as long as there are less than 4 items in the dictionary while len(meals) &lt; length: name = input(&quot;Name a food.&quot;) rating = input(&quot;How would you rate the meal on a scale of 1 - 10?&quot;) meals[name] = rating # determines the key and the value print(meals) . {&#39;pineapple pizza&#39;: &#39;5&#39;, &#39;chicken alfredo&#39;: &#39;8&#39;, &#39;fried chicken&#39;: &#39;10&#39;, &#39;mango&#39;: &#39;9&#39;} . Recursion . Recursive functions are helpful, but can be inefficient since it keeps on recalling the function. . def factorial(i): # defining the function if i == 0: # will not recall function return 1 if i == 1: # will not recall function return i if i != 1: return i * factorial(i - 1) # recalls the function, but at lesser value print(factorial(5)) print(factorial(0)) print(factorial(1)) . 120 1 1 . Tools . Using other capabilities to organize lists. These are very useful tools. . Reverse Order . Command to output a list in reverse order. . countdown = [3, 2, 1] # New list print(countdown) countdown.reverse() # Reversing the list print(countdown) . [3, 2, 1] [1, 2, 3] . This shows that the .reverse() statement is used to reverse a list. . Sort and Set . More functions that can help to alphabetize lists as well as make sure there are no duplicates in the list. . cake_flavors = [&quot;chocolate&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;vanilla&quot;] # Appending multiple items cake_flavors.append(&quot;red velvet&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;lemon&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;marble&quot;) print(cake_flavors) # Printing the new list # Sort function cake_flavors.sort() print(cake_flavors) # Alphabetized list # Appending more flavors cake_flavors.append(&quot;lemon&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;german chocolate&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;carrot&quot;) print(cake_flavors) cake_flavors = set(cake_flavors) print(cake_flavors) . [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;, &#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;] [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;, &#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;] [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;, &#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;german chocolate&#39;, &#39;carrot&#39;] {&#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;carrot&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;, &#39;german chocolate&#39;, &#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;} . Showcases the .append(), .sort(), and set(). Append adds a new item to the list, sort puts the list in alphabetical order, and set removes any duplicatte items. . Quiz . Creating a quiz like last week, except using a list of dictionaries. This makes it easier to store questions and answers as key and value pairs. . quiz = [] # empty list #variables question_count = 5 score = 0 # appending some questions quiz.append({ &quot;What type of language is Python&quot; : &quot;object oriented&quot;, &quot;How do you get an output in Python?&quot; : &quot;print&quot; }) quiz.append({ &quot;Is a dictionary a primitive or a collection?&quot; : &quot;collection&quot;, &quot;How do you add more information to a list?&quot; : &quot;append&quot;, &quot;What do you need to call to get the value in a dictionary?&quot; : &quot;key&quot; }) # function to print questions and get answers def questioning(ask): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + ask) global ans ans = input() print(&quot;Answer: &quot; + ans) # for loop to iterate through the dictionary for dict in quiz: for question, answer in dict.items(): # for the key and value pair questioning(question) # calling function if ans.lower() == answer: score += 1 print(&quot;Your answer is correct.&quot;) else: print(&quot;You are incorrect.&quot;) # percentage calculator from last time def grade(sco, quests): percent = 100 * float(sco)/float(quests) return percent quiz_percentage = grade(score, question_count) # Defining variable print(&quot;You got &quot; + str(score) + &quot; of &quot; + str(question_count) + &quot; questions correct.&quot;) print(&quot;Your score is &quot; + str(quiz_percentage) + &quot;%.&quot;) . Question: What type of language is Python Answer: OBJECT ORiented Your answer is correct. Question: How do you get an output in Python? Answer: pRINT Your answer is correct. Question: Is a dictionary a primitive or a collection? Answer: primitive You are incorrect. Question: How do you add more information to a list? Answer: APPEnd Your answer is correct. Question: What do you need to call to get the value in a dictionary? Answer: kEY Your answer is correct. You got 4 of 5 questions correct. Your score is 80.0%. .",

Finding the secrets of .git! . Learning about bash was really interesting to see the many things it can show the user. It looks like it can be a very helpful tool. . Hacks . Is there anything we use to verify tools we install? Think about versions. . Using the bash script, we can use --version option for each of the tools to verify which version of the tool is installed. For example, executing the command python --version in bash will give us the version of python the user has installed. This helps to verify the tool that has been set up, and tells the version, so the user can know if they want to update it. Also, we can use conda list to check the programs and their versions. . Is there anything we could verify with Anaconda? . Using conda list, we can verify the programs installed. This is also useful to see what version of the program is installed. . How would you update a repository? . To update a remote repository with changes made to the local repository, we can use git push to push changes from a local repository to the remote repository. To update a local repository with changes made to the remote repository, we use git pull to pull the changes from the remote repository to the local repository. Additionally, git add and git commit are used to stage and commit changes. . Really cool would be automating a procedure from installation. . This can be done by writing and running programs using the Shell Script. .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
