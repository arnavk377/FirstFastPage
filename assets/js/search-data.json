I also used algorithms to manipulate lists in certain ways. It is important to check the values of indices for certain programs. Indices are very important in lists because they have the value of where each data point is located. . Quiz . I scored an 8/10 on the quiz. I got questions 7 and 9 wrong. . Question 7 . Link to Image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v6sMC8NobA_R4UbF3aJBKvRwTDdfT_xb/view?usp=sharing . Question: What is Base 0 Indexing? | Actual Answer: Seguence demarcated with an Index starting from 0 | . I originally answered a) Binary, thinking that this would refer to the 0s and 1s. This was a silly mistake, and I forgot that Binary conversions are done with base 2. When a list has an index of 0 for its first element, this would be Base 0 Indexing, since the first index is at 0. . Question 9 .

What loop would I use? | Actual Answer: FOR loops | . My first answer was while loops because I thought it would make sense for the command to run while a certain condition is true, which would be if the user has not quit. FOR loops would work because it could include for every action, which could include opening an app, lowering the brightness, or shutting down the machine and quitting. . Reflection . I thought I did decently well on the quiz. It will be important to pay attention to what the question is asking for to prevent silly mistakes. I will also need to remember to think through problems, and go through each answer choice to find the best one. . Important Notes .

In this example code, we first import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We then load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. We print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using the df.head() function. Next, we calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using the appropriate Pandas methods, and print the results. And, we create a histogram of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using Matplotlib by calling the plt.hist() function and setting appropriate axis labels and a title. We then call the plt.show() method to display the plot. Even though NumPy is not directly used in this code, it is an important underlying component of the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, which are used to load, manipulate and visualize data. It allows them to work more efficiently . Lesson Portion 5; Summary . Summary/Goals of Lesson: . One of our goals was to make you understand data analysis and how it can be important in optimizing business performance. We also wanted to make sure you understood the use of Pandas and NumPy libraries in data analysis, with a focus on NumPy. As someone who works with data, we find Pandas incredibly useful for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python. The way we use pandas is to calculate individual player and team statistics. We are a group that works with numerical data, so NumPy is one of our favorite tools for working with arrays and applying mathematical functions to them. It is very fast at computing and manipulating arrays making it a very valuable tool for tracking statistics which is important to our group. For example, if you have an array of the points scored by each player in a game, you can use NumPy to calculate the total points scored, average points per player, or the highest and lowest scoring players. .

            "content": "Notes . Different algorithms can be created but still complete the same task | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different results | Boolean expressions can be written as equivalent conditional statements, and the opposite can be true | Different algorithms can be developed to solve similar problems | However, small changes to algorithms could also yield vastly different results | Modifications and combinations of algorithms can create new ideas | Algorithm: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer | Binary Search: starts at the middle of a sorted data set of numbers and eliminates half of the data; this process repeats until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated | Data has to be sorted in order | Binary search is often more efficient than a sequential search | . Question 1 . IF (isCold OR isRaining) { stayInside &lt;-- True } ELSE { stayInside &lt;-- False } . Question 2 . Psuedocode and python . numbers &lt;-- [RANDOM(1,10), RANDOM(1,10), RANDOM(1,10), RANDOM(1,10)] topScore &lt;-- numbers[1] IF topScore &lt; numbers[2] { topScore &lt;-- numbers[2] } IF topScore &lt; numbers[3] { topScore &lt;-- numbers[3] } IF topScore &lt; numbers[4] { topScore &lt;-- numbers[4] } DISPLAY (topScore) . import random numbers = [] counter = 1 topScore = 0 while counter &lt;= 4: current = random.randint(1, 10) numbers.append(current) counter += 1 for i in range(0, len(numbers)): if numbers[i] &gt; topScore: topScore = numbers[i] else: topScore = topScore print(numbers) print(&quot;Your high score is &quot; + str(topScore) + &quot;!&quot;) . [6, 10, 7, 1] Your high score is 10! . Question 3 . REPEAT UNTIL (goalReached){ IF (CAN_MOVE(FORWARD)) { MOVE_FORWARD } ELSE{ IF (CAN_ROTATE(RIGHT)) { ROTATE_RIGHT } ELSE { ROTATE_LEFT } } } . Question 4 . See image . Question 5 . To select the number 69, you must go through binary search. First, you must find the middle value by adding the first(1) and last index(8) value and dividing by 2. Since that value is a decimal(3.5), round up(4), and the element is 6. | This is not the intended value, so take each half of the list, before the middle and after the middle and repeat binary search. Repeating this process for the first half finds a middle value of that portion(1+4/2 = 2.5, round to index 3, whose element has a value of 3). For the back half of the list, we repeat this value, with the 6-8th elements, selecting index 7, which has a value of 11. | Since the value of 69 is not found, we must repeat the binary search process. Now, the back half only has the endpoints to be checked, indices 6 and 8. Index 6 is 9, which is not the intended value, but index 8 is the intended value of 69. | . Question 6 . See image . Question 7 . An order that can be used for binary search is: . [&quot;Market&quot;, &quot;Ralphs&quot;, &quot;store&quot;, &quot;Target&quot;, &quot;Walmart&quot;] This is because the strings are in alphabetical order, which would make sense. | . Question 8 . Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because binary search allows the computer to check exponentially more numbers each search. A binary search algorithm keeps on multiplying the amount of numbers checked by 2 each time. The sequential search checks each element individually, which will probably take a longer time, since the algorithm must go through every item of a list. . Question 9 . See image . To find the number 36, it would take 2 checks. The middle value on the first check would be 16, the 3rd index((1+5)/2). Then, we take the parts of the list on each side of the middle element. Before 16 are 64 and 36, while after 16 are 11 and 9. For the first part of the list there are 2 indices, 1 and 2. Using the binary search formula, (1+2)/2 = 1.5, which rounds up to the element at index 2, which is 36, the designated value. . def binary_search(list, value): bottom = 0 top = len(list) - 1 mid = 0 while bottom &lt;= top: mid = (bottom + top) // 2 if list[mid] &lt; value: bottom = mid + 1 elif list[mid] &gt; value: top = mid - 1 else: return mid return -1 numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] x = 4 test = binary_search(numbers, x) if test != -1: print(&quot;Element&quot;, str(x), &quot;is present at index&quot;, str(test)) else: print(&quot;Element is not present in array&quot;) . Element 4 is present at index 3 .",

            "title": "KASM on AWS EC2",
            "content": "KASM Information . KASM is relatively simple to install for such a powerful software. It allows us to use Docker based containers to complete actions on numerous platforms, from browsing the web on Chrome to running code on VS Code. . KASM allows anonymous containers to be accessed from any computer, which will be useful in allowing school chromebooks to run coding applications. . KASM is also highly customizable because of its usage of Docker containers. Docker containers can be used to run various applications if a user has created a container. Additionally, KASM can be integrated into browsers to safely open links and webistes. After a user is done with a running container, it will be stopped and there will be no evidence on the web that the container was ever open. . Preparing an Instance . Before running KASM, there will be a few requirements to set up the AWS Instance. Log in to the AWS interface and select launch instance to begin. . Minimum Requirements . The minimum system requirements for KASM are: . 2 CPU Cores | 4 GB Memory | 50 GB Storage | OS must be Ubuntu 22.04 or 20.04 These requirements are met by an AWS EC2 t.2 medium server and I will be using the OS setup of Ubuntu 22.04. Be sure to ask your teacher for permission before creating a t.2 medium server since these ones are not Free Tier Eligible. | . from PIL import Image t2setts = Image.open(&quot;../images/t2setts.png&quot;) display(t2setts) . System Partition . In order to create a KASM instance, there needs to be a partition created. We will create the partition right now. Connect to your console and run the commands below. . free -h # Shows Free storage on disk lsblk # Shows partitions and drives . NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS loop0 7:0 0 24.4M 1 loop /snap/amazon-ssm-agent/6312 loop1 7:1 0 63.3M 1 loop /snap/core20/1852 loop2 7:2 0 55.6M 1 loop /snap/core18/2714 loop3 7:3 0 111.9M 1 loop /snap/lxd/24322 loop4 7:4 0 49.8M 1 loop /snap/snapd/18596 xvda 202:0 0 8G 0 disk ├─xvda1 202:1 0 7.9G 0 part / ├─xvda14 202:14 0 4M 0 part └─xvda15 202:15 0 106M 0 part /boot/efi # The xvda drive will be important for us # We will be using a partition in xvda . Now, exit out of the console, and navigate to the volumes tab for the instance. We will need to modify the volume. . from PIL import Image volumen = Image.open(&quot;../images/volumen.png&quot;) display(volumen) . Go to the modify tab and then increase the instance size. KASM needs at least 50 GB of storage, so I opted to change my storage to 60 GB from the original 8. . from PIL import Image modifyv = Image.open(&quot;../images/modifyv.png&quot;) display(modifyv) . After that, we can exit the volumes tab and reconnect to the instance. . Since we changed the volume, there will be a few commands which we need to run in order to make sure that our instance will run with the change in volume. . sudo parted -l # Output will ask for a &quot;Fix/Ignore?&quot;, input &quot;fix&quot; # Will fix the instance volume after the change in volume sudo fdisk /dev/xvda # Change xvda if that is not the disk you will be using # This will open the fdisk utility for altering the drive, be careful with the commands entered # Type each of these letters into fdisk n # Creates new partition # For settings, you can just enter through all of them if you would like, which will create a partition in the default name and of maximum size p # Goes over the changes made w # Writes the changes to the disk sudo fdisk -l # shows the changes made to the drive partprobe # Steps to ensure that the swap will stay sudo mkswap /dev/xvda2 # xvda2 is the swap partition, change to your own name if needed # Copy the UUID listed after running the command sudo swapon /dev/xvda2 sudo blkid # Will list out a lot of things, get the uuid of the partition which you created # Now we will need to alter fstab to save the partition sudo vi /etc/fstab # Press &quot;i&quot; to insert in vi and create a new line to save the swap # Follow this template to save the swap UUID=&quot;d13a2905-ed9c-4ea8-b35f-4933ba12d1ed&quot; none swap sw 0 0 # Replace UUID with that of your own partition # Press &quot;esc&quot; to exit insert mode # Enter &quot;:wq!&quot; to exit vi editor . The swap should be created, so now you can restart your instance in order to check the swap. Run commands like &quot;free -h&quot; and &quot;lsblk&quot; to confirm. . Downloading KASM . Now, we can download KASM after our storage has been altered. Connect to your instance and run the following commands. . sudo mkdir kasmdir # Makes new directory for kasm cd kasmdir sudo curl -O https://kasm-static-content.s3.amazonaws.com/kasm_release_1.13.0.002947.tar.gz # Will fetch the zip file for KASM from the internet sudo tar -xf kasm_release_1.13.0.002947.tar.gz # Unzips the files sudo bash kasm_release/install.sh -L 8084 # Runs the install script # The &quot;-L 8084&quot; specifies a port for the install, which has a default port of 443 . Save the login credentials which KASM outputs, as you will not be able to access them again. After that, KASM should be installed. However, there are a few steps we must take before we can access the site. . Creating Outbound Rules . We will need to go to the Security group of the instance. We will need to add security instances for the ports. . Once clicking on the instance, click on the Security tab and go to the security group. . from PIL import Image security = Image.open(&quot;../images/security.png&quot;) display(security) . Now, we have to have some ports which will be able to be accessed. The 22 port is already exposed, but I exposed port 80 with HTTP and the port I included in the install(8084) with a custom TCP. Set the Source to 0.0.0.0/0. . from PIL import Image addports = Image.open(&quot;../images/addingport.png&quot;) display(addports) . Now we will be able to access the instance. Go to [Public IP]:[Port] and there should be a KASM desktop waiting for you to log in. . Things to Do on KASM .

Explain how the Tic Tac Toe game works The game of Tic Tac Toe works by creating a 2D array with 3 lists in one list. Then, the user selects the position where they would like to place their mark. There need to be 2 numbers input, to choose the row and the column, since there are rows and columns and select which index of the outer list and then the index of the inner list. Then, the program checks if there is a value at the point and will continue to run if there isn&#39;t. Finally, after multiple turns have been run, the program checks if there is a row or diagonal completely filled out to see if there is a winner. If not, there is a tie. | . | Games which can be made from arrays Games which can be made from arrays include Chess, Checkers, and Battleship. You could probably also create a Snake game or pretty much any flat, 2D game. | . | . Lists and Dictionaries . Lists and dictionaries are both ways to store numerous values. Lists store values based on indices, while dictionaries store key-value pairs. This means that dictionaries store 2 values for every one of a list. So, a dictionary will end up taking more space for a list with the same number of indices as key-pairs. Dictionaries will probably have different types of values, like strings, integers, or floats. A list will probably hold values of a uniform type. These are both powerful things which can manage complexity for programmers. . langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C++&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Javascript&quot;] s_langs = sorted(langs) print(s_langs) .

I could probably cut down on a few mistakes in order to ensure a higher score for the next practice test. . . Corrections . Question 14 . Incorrect Answer: D. Program A and program B display a different number of values. | Correct Answer: C. Program A and program B display the same number of values, but the values differ. I chose the incorrect answer because I thought that there would be a difference in values which are the output because they have the i = i+1 step at different points in the algorithm. However, I was incorrect because it takes the same number of iterations to stop each algorithm, since the check for the value for i happens after the i = i+1 and display code are run, depending on the order for the algorithm. So, since there are the same number of iterations, the number of values displayed will be the same. However, the values will be different. | . Question 21 . Incorrect Answer: A. MoveXTimes: 2, RightXTimes: 1, MoveXTimes: 3 | Correct Answer: B. MoveXTimes: 2, RightXTimes: 3, MoveXTimes: 3 I was incorrect because I did not realize that the robot had to move left instead of right. So, the RightXTimes function would need to be called in order for the robot to be facing left. | . Question 37 . Incorrect Answer: B. Code segment II displays the correct average, but code segment I does not. | Correct Answer: C. Both code segments display the correct average, but code segment I requires more arithmetic operations than code segment II. I was incorrect because I did not pay attention to the problem and did not realize that two code segments actually displayed the same value. I did not realize that the average which was computed in every iteration of code segment I would actually get the correct average after all of the values had been summed up and then divided by the length of the list. So, the average step is unnecessary each iteration but will provide the correct answer. | . Reflection . I think I did better on this MC test and feel a bit better about my progress and learning. I felt pretty confident about the topics and could remember things from the Tech Talks we did in class. In every MC practice, it has been evident that I have a few silly mistakes, so if I can cut down on those, I will get even better scores. .",

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP).

My Answer: B(Each packet contains an encrypted version of the data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing the key needed to decrypt the data.) –&gt; I had the wrong definition of how packets are assembled. The metadata would not have the key to decrypt the data | Correct: A(Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data.) –&gt; The packet has to have the data transmitted, and the metadata is important to describe the data | . Q9 . My Answer: B(The file is broken into packets for transmission. The user’s browser must request each packet in order until all packets are received.) –&gt; I did not realize that when a file is broken down to transmit, it does not need to have its packets received in order. | Correct: A(The file is broken into packets for transmission. The packets must be reassembled upon receipt.) –&gt; The packets are broken down and received and then rebuilt to get the file. | . Q41 . My Answer: A(A procedure containsNegatives, which returns true if any negative values appear in the column and returns false otherwise.) –&gt; I did not realize that this would work for the entire column and not check each row individually. | Correct: C(A procedure findNegative, which returns the row number of the first negative value that appears in the column or -1 if there are no negative values.) –&gt; This procedure checks each row for a negative value, which was asked for by the requirements. | . Q43 . My Answer: D(Reducing the amount of duplicated code) –&gt; Procedural Abstraction would help to be able to generalize the code and have procedures to run the same tasks. | Correct: B(Making the code run faster) –&gt; The procedural abstraction would probably make the code easier to read, but this does not mean the code would run faster. So, this is not a benefit of procedural abstraction. | . Q49 . My Answer: B –&gt; I did not realize that this code would compare the first value of the code, which will be the maximum value, to the scores, so it would incorrectly return true. | Correct: A –&gt; This code will not compare the first value, so it will check each student earned score and then determine if they got the maximum points possible. | . Reflection . Obviously, I wish I could have done better on this quiz in order to achieve a higher score. I could have cut down on silly mistakes by reading through the problems carefully. I did not feel the best about data encryption and transmission, so I should definitely look at those topics before the AP exam in order to ensure the highest possible score. .",

KASM is a virtual desktop interface. It uses Docker containers to be able to stream the desktop to a browser site where the user can access it. . Why KASM? . Using KASM will allow students to be able to access tools like Visual Studio Code without needing their own personal computer. This would help lower the digital divide and allow students to use school issued chromebooks in APCSP and APCSA. . Relations to Big Idea 4 .

This is a challenging task because this is a very new topic for me, but I will remain persistent. I learned about creating partitions on the EC2 instance and found a helpful resource for that. I was also able to do a single server installation of kasm but I am not sure if it works. Here are some pictures denoting my progress. I have come across a curl error which has stumped me so far, but I also have some containers working, so that is a success. . Hack Ideas . Trying to have each group set up a KASM server seems a little much because of the resources we have and the time it would probably take. I think it would be good to have each group go through the guide and answer a few questions about the steps in the guide. I could include questions about partitions and about the container used. . Project Ideas . For the final project, I think it would be good to showcase using KASM and being able to have our group&#39;s work run on a site through the kasm environment. This would show functionality of kasm and would help ensure the quality project. . from PIL import Image k1 = Image.open(&#39;../images/kwork1.png&#39;) k2 = Image.open(&#39;../images/kwork2.png&#39;) display(k1) display(k2) .",

            "title": "Data Structures- Hashmaps, Sets, Hash Tables, Hashing and Collisions",
            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # # The output is a dictionary. The set converts this list into a dictionary. # Additionally, there are no duplicate values. The extra 2 and 1 are removed from the dictionary which is outputted. # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # # I think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps and Hashtables because they allow for data to be cleaned and have only one unique value in a dictionary. # The set function may be used as a function which can prepare a dictionary which is a hashmaps. # . {1, 2, 3} . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary.

Parallel Computing . In parallel or concurrent mode, the ThreadPoolExecutor is used to submit each image to a separate worker thread, allowing multiple images to be processed simultaneously. Multithreading allows multiple concurrent tasks of a process at the same time. The executor.map() method is used to apply the process_image function to each image in the images list. .

Provide answers and thoughts on theoritical question form college board Video in section 4.3. They start at about the 9 minute mark. . Example 1:This would take 50 seconds to complete. The shortest time would include one processor working on task X for 50 seconds and the other working on task Y for 10 seconds. The second processor on task Y would finish and then take another 30 seconds for task Z. This would complete tasks Y and Z in 40 seconds, while X finishes in 50 seconds. So the maximum time it takes is 50 seconds.- Example 2: Running both processes together would take 25+45 seconds, or 70 seconds. Running them both in parallel would result in running one task in 25 and the other in 45 at the same time. This makes it 45 seconds. The amount saved is 70-45 seconds, or 25 seconds. | .

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . I think a programmer should care about space and time complexity because it is important to consider the resources and time of the programmers. This is important for making code as fast as possible and making sure there is minimal loading. Additionally, programs do not have unlimited storage to run, so we have to work under constraints of storage space. | . Take a look at our lassen volcano example from the data compression tech talk. The first code block is the original image. In the second code block, change the baseWidth to rescale the image. . This takes more time when you increase the baseWidth and scale the image to a higher resolution. This generates more pixels for the image and thus takes more time to load the image. So, having a larger baseWidth will require more time, and may not be necessary to scale to the maximum baseWidth in order to save resources. | . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;../images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: lassen_volcano = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}]) image_display(lassen_volcano) . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image as pilImage from io import BytesIO import base64 # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;../images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def scale_image(img): #baseWidth = 625 #baseWidth = 1250 baseWidth = 2500 #baseWidth = 5000 # see the effect of doubling or halfing the baseWidth #baseWidth = 10000 #baseWidth = 20000 #baseWidth = 40000 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;width&#39;], image[&#39;height&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;pixels&#39;] = image[&#39;width&#39;] * image[&#39;height&#39;] # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;scaled_width&#39;], image[&#39;scaled_height&#39;] = img.size image[&#39;scaled_pixels&#39;] = image[&#39;scaled_width&#39;] * image[&#39;scaled_height&#39;] # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data(images = [{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}]) # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;], &quot; pixels: &quot;, f&quot;{image[&#39;pixels&#39;]:,}&quot;) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;], &quot; pixels: &quot;, f&quot;{image[&#39;scaled_pixels&#39;]:,}&quot;) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) . This code takes longer to run with a higher baseWidth. It is important to maintain a low enough baseWidth value for the code to run in a reasonable time. . Computer usually does not respond with higher baseWidth due to not being powerful enough | . Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . I think this is both a time and space complexity. You do not want the image to be too large and take up too much space for the program. Additionally, having a larger image with a larger baseWidth will take more time to generate. So, it is important to keep both space and time in mind when using the image scaler.

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . The amount of memory and the time it took to run both of these code segments was constant. This is good for a programmer because we always know the values of the constraints. However, these are very limited pieces of code and in order to make things more complex, we will need to have code which is more complex. . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 889 890 891 892 893 894 895 896 897 898 899 900 901 902 903 904 905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 920 921 922 923 924 925 926 927 928 929 930 931 932 933 934 935 936 937 938 939 940 941 942 943 944 945 946 947 948 949 950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969 970 971 972 973 974 975 976 977 978 979 980 981 982 983 984 985 986 987 988 989 990 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . These code segments show code which is linear in space and time. This helps us understand that the space and time values are variable upon the length of the list. This makes it easy for programmers to be able to estimate how long a code will run for. This can sometimes be inefficient, but a programmer will probably be able to make good predictions for linear space and time algorithms. . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . [Example of Matrix Multiplication] . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . This is quadratic space and time. It makes new matrices and takes more time as the lists get longer. This makes it harder to predict and see how much storage and time it will take. . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . [A visualization of calculating the fibonacci sequence] . Fibonacci: process of adding the most recent numbers of a series to get the next number(ex. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc.) | . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) #print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) print(generate_subsets([1,2,3,4,5,6])) print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | It takes more time with higher values of the function. | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(36)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. They take more time with higher time or space complexity | Often make the computer lag or sometimes VS Code will not respond | . | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. Binary search: will continuously discard half of the list searched to find an item, space complexity is O(1), time is O(log N) | Searching through each element of the list has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1) | Bubble sort: sorts the list based on previous elements and will switch the order of the list, time complexity is O(n^2), space complexity is O(1) | These are some common sorting and search algorithms we have experience with and I look forward to learning about the time and space complexity of other searches | . | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? Time and space complexity is important when choosing an algorithm because it allows the user to have a program which can run on time and not use up enough storage in order to make sure that resources are conserved. | . | Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? While constant time algorithms are more sure and will always have the same time, it is not always possible to have an algorithm which runs with constant time. For example, if you need to compare every item in a list to each element, this can become exponential time. While it is usually better to use a constant time algorithm, since time is conserved, it may be necessary to use exponential time. | . | What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? Usually, the algorithms with higher time and space complexity usually have defined multiple variables. The constant time and space code segments usually have variables which are not dependent on how long a certain variable or list is. They track the same amount of things each time. | . | . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice . Answer Choice C: The time depends on the values of M and N, but they are independent of each other, so it iterates through each length. There are no new variables created | Answer D: The code runs twice for each N, resulting in a N*N time complexity. | Answer B: The code runs for each N and also runs for each logarithmic N. | Answer B: If X runs at a lower time for large inputs, it will be better. | Answer D: The code takes the value of i and divides it in half | Answer C: You want to take into consideration both the space and time complexity of an algorithm. | Answer B: This is how a time complexity algorithm works | Answer C: The algorithm loops k^n-1 times. | Answer C: Runs the first algorithm n times.

This code uses a lot of complexities in order to run. While this code could be written in a way to conserve a little more time and space, I wanted to play around with the time and space complexities. The code checks through 2 user inputted words whether the words have the same length and if they have any matching characters at the same index spots. If they do, the user is rewarded one point for each matching character or of the words being the same length. Time: O(i+j) The code goes through each unique list, and then checks each list against each other once. Space: O(i+j) This is a linear space complexity because there are some items created, like the score variable, but the values of list1 and list2 are dependent on the values of word1 and word2. Overall, this was somewhat challenging to determine the space and time complexity of, but good practice and helped show me why it is important to keep space and time complexity in mind, in order to prevent the code from becoming too clunky. .",

This is definitely a pretty good score, but I could have scored even more points if I had cut down on my silly mistakes. . Question 1 . . This question asked about binary and it is important to remember how bits are used to represent binary numbers. Here, I did my math incorrectly and thought 7 bits were needed to represent a number in the hundreds. I did my calculations incorrectly and I should have realized that 2 to the 6th power is 128. . Question 2 . . This question asked about lossless and lossy image compression. These are two things which we have been going over in class with the tech talks, so I did feel experienced with the questions. I felt pretty comfortable with other questions on this quiz asking about lossy and lossless compression. Here, I did not read the question properly. Lossless compression only allows for it to be made sure that data can be reconstructed, it does not do anything with the security purposes. . Reflection . I felt a lot better on this quiz, but there were also some questions which I had seen before. I can continue to cut down on errors by getting into the zone of test taking and making sure to read the questions carefully and make sure that I check my answers to the questions. .",

The data types in a SQL table include integers, floats, and strings. | . | . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() # schema is the metadata for a database schema() .

Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? A connection object is an object which allows us to connect with the sqlite db to be able to interact with it. | . | Same for cursor object? A cursor object is an object which allows us to search through the sql database. These allow us to work with sqlite db. | . | Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? Attributes in the object include | . | Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? &quot;results&quot; is an object. We know this because it is a collection of information and has some methods. | . | . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM users&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() read() .

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compare create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? The code for this create is much shorter. It requires the conn and cursor objects to be opened and closed. The cursor must execute a code which takes all of the variables and adds it to the table. | . | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? SQL INSERT allows rows to be added to an SQL database table. The User init function allows a dataset which is defined to be able to added to an SQL database. This serves a similar purpose. | . | . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? The hacked part of the update function outputs a message to the user if the length of the password is too short. This serves as authentication for the user to make sure that a password is long enough for security purposes. | . | Explain try/except, when would except occur? Try and except work as things which check if certain code is running/working. Try runs if the code is working smoothly, and in this case serves to update the password. Except occurs if there is an error with the connection and cursor with the database. This serves as a good way to check errors if there is something wrong with the code. | . | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? Code that seems to be repeated include import sqlite3, defining the conn and cursor methods, cursor execute, conn.commit(), and conn and cursor close. This code seems to be repeated because it is required to connect and use the cursor method in the database. cursor.execute() seems to run the wanted code, whether it is update, delete, read, etc. conn.commit() appears that it commits the changes to the database in order to make the changes permanent. The closing of cursor and conn appears to be present because it is important be able to close the working connections and cursors in order to be able to have different ones. This is especially important when working with servers because it makes sure to have orderly code and prevents resources from being used unnecessarily. | . | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ? WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (password, uid)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: print(f&quot;The row with user id {uid} the password has been {message}&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the UPDATE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() update() . No uid was not found in the table . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? DELETE can be a dangerous operation because it can remove information from the database, and if placed in the wrong hands, they could delete important information by accident. However, delete is also necessary in order to maintain a clean database with proper records. | . | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? In the print statements, the &quot;f&quot; and {uid} allow the coder to include the selected uid without having to add multiple strings in the print statement. It allows for easy replacement and making a statement which uses the variable which the user called for. | . | . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? The menu repeats so the user has access to the functions multiple times if they want, instead of having to restart the code cell every time they want to try a new function. | . | Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? This menu could be refactored, to reduce the number of elif statements had. Refactoring allows the code to be cleaned up and become more organized. The menu could be held in a list or dictionary and based on the output, the specific function would occur. | . | . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . options = [(&#39;c&#39;, create), (&#39;r&#39;, read), (&#39;u&#39;, update), (&#39;d&#39;, delete), (&#39;s&#39;, schema)] def rmenu(): while True: operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) found = False for op, func in options: if operation.lower() == op: func() # call corresponding function found = True break if not found and len(operation)&gt;0: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, d, or s&quot;) elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key break rmenu() .

Hacks . Add this Blog to you own Blogging site. In the Blog add notes and observations on each code cell. | In this implementation, do you see procedural abstraction? Yes, this implementation has a lot of procedural abstraction. There are functions created in order to be able to define what procedures we want to do in the code. For example, there are procedures defined for create, read, update, and delete. This allows us to have a broad function which can be used to add information to specific rows of the database. | . | In 2.4a or 2.4b lecture Do you see data abstraction? Complement this with Debugging example. There is data abstraction in this code. There are many things which are defined when creating a user, from their name to password to date of birth. These all need to be stored together, and using the code, we create a specific uid for the user which allows the rest of the data to be called from. The uid is essential in functions like update and delete, where data is removed or changed based on the user-specific uid. | . | Use Imperative or OOP style to Create a new Table or do something that applies to your CPT project.

Q: Which of the following is an advantage of a lossless compression algorithm over a lossy compression algorithm? | A: A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot. | This means that the lossless compression algorithm will be able to save all the data of a file, while a lossy compression algorithm will maintain mostly the essential information. | This can be applied to how a lossy compression algorithm can be used to reduce files to the smallest size possible and lossless compression algorithms can be used to maintain the same data of a file even after compression. | . Q2 . Q: A user wants to save a data file on an online storage site. The user wants to reduce the size of the file, if possible, and wants to be able to completely restore the file to its original version. Which of the following actions best supports the user’s needs? | A: Compressing the file using a lossless compression algorithm before uploading it | A lossless algorithm allows the original file to be restored, which may be the reason of the name of lossless | A lossless algorithm can help maintain information of a file but help cut down on file size. This could be used for important things like word processing or database records. | . Q3 . Q: A programmer is developing software for a social media platform. The programmer is planning to use compression when users send attachments to other users. Which of the following is a true statement about the use of compression? | A: Lossy compression of an image file generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than lossless compression does. | Lossy compression will reduce the image file to have only the minimum data necessary, but a lossless compression will be able to restore all data. So, it makes sense for lossy images to be able to transmit faster. | A lossy compressed image will be used when a lot of files need to be stored and something needs to be reduced to the minimum. | . Reflection . Lossy and lossless compression are very important to understand. They both have different implications for a file. They also have different pros and cons for files. Being able to understand when to use the different types of compressions will be important as a developer in order to create quality algorithms which fit my overall purpose well. . Extracting Information from Data . Q1 . Q: Upon compiling the data, the researcher identifies a problem due to the fact that neither data source uses a unique ID number for each student. Which of the following best describes the problem caused by the lack of unique ID numbers? | A: Students who have the same name may be confused with each other. | Since both datasets had first name and last name, but no unique identification, it would be possible to confuse two students for the same person. | This shows how important it is to have distinct characteristics for each piece of data. Using ID numbers can help solve this problem. | . Q2 . Q: A team of researchers wants to create a program to analyze the amount of pollution reported in roughly 3,000 counties across the United States. The program is intended to combine county data sets and then process the data. Which of the following is most likely to be a challenge in creating the program? | A: Different counties may organize data in different ways. | Not all areas would have the same way of ordering and organizing data, so there could be different forms of data sets. | This is why data cleaning is important for data collectors, in order to make all the data in the same style so that programs will be able to easily run on them. | . Q3 . Q: A student is creating a Web site that is intended to display information about a city based on a city name that a user enters in a text field. Which of the following are likely to be challenges associated with processing city names that users might provide as input? | A: Users might enter abbreviations for the names of cities.; Users might misspell the name of the city. | There are many types of errors which can arise when taking in user input. So, it is important to have checks in order to make sure that there is no garbage which will be able to get into the data set. | Implementing checks will be able to ensure that the user gets the best experience. | . Q4 . Q: Which of the following additional pieces of information would be most useful in determining the artist with the greatest attendance during a particular month? | A: Average ticket price | Given that the total dollar amount of all tickets sold is given, dividing that number by average ticket price would give a good estimate of the amount of tickets which are sold. | . Q5 . Q: A camera mounted on the dashboard of a car captures an image of the view from the driver’s seat every second. Each image is stored as data. Along with each image, the camera also captures and stores the car’s speed, the date and time, and the car’s GPS location as metadata. Which of the following can best be determined using only the data and none of the metadata? | A: The number of bicycles the car passed on a particular day | The dashboard of the car will be able to tell how much distance is traveled, the time, or the speed. These can all be estimated, but will never be accurate. However, the number of bicycles passed will be able to be compiled from the photos, thus making this the correct answer. | This shows how some important things like metadata may not be able to be accessed from the direct photo, but from metadata, while other things can only be found in the photo. Thus, it is important to be able to identify where to get the data from. | . Q6 . Q: Which of the following questions about the students who responded to the survey can the teacher answer by analyzing the survey results? Do students who enjoy the subject material tend to spend more time on homework each night than the other students do? Do students who spend more time on homework each night tend to spend less time studying for tests than the other students do? Do students who spend more time studying for tests tend to earn higher grades in the class than the other students do? | A: I and II | The last question can’t be answered because the data set does not include a way to reference the answers to a student, since it is anonymous. So, the third question can’t be answered. | It is important to be able to tell what type of data is stored in a data set to ensure there are efficient programs being used. | . Reflection . These questions showed me the multiple ways that data can be received. They also show the importance of being able to go through databases and get the data which you want. This is essential to creating the algorithms which you want, because you want to be able to understand what the data you have can and can’t do. . Using Programs . Q1 . Q: For a given row in the spreadsheet, suppose genre contains the genre as a string, num contains the number of copies in stock as a number, and cost contains the cost as a number. Which of the following expressions will evaluate to true if the book should be counted and evaluates to false otherwise? | A: (genre = “mystery”) AND ((1 ≤ num) AND (cost &lt; 10.00)) | This makes sure that all the necessary requirements are met through AND conditionals/ | . Q2 . Q: Using only the data collected during the 7-day period, which of the following statements is true? | A: The total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined by searching the data for all transactions that occurred on the given date and then adding the number of items purchased for each matching transaction. | This is the only answer choice which uses data from the given dataset, so it is the only correct answer. | . Q3 . Q: A new rechargeable battery pack is available for products that use AA batteries. Which of the following best explains how the data files in the table can be used to send a targeted e-mail to only those customers who have purchased products that use AA batteries to let them know about the new accessory? | A: Use the products file to generate a list of product IDs that use AA batteries, then use the list of product IDs to search the purchases file to generate a list of customer IDs, then use the list of customer IDs to search the customers file to generate a list of e-mail addresses | This answer specifically finds customers who have purchased products using AA batteries and emails them. This is important to a efficient algorithm which helps both the business and the consumers. | . Q4 . Q: Which of the following sequences of steps can be used to identify the desired entry? | A: Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by year; Sort by year, then filter by year, then filter by photographer | These both make sure that the picture selected is of a confirmed photographer and year. This ensures all requirements are met. | . Q5 . Q: For a given row in the spreadsheet, suppose genre contains the genre as a string and day contains the day as a string. Which of the following expressions will evaluate to true if the show should be counted and evaluates to false otherwise? | A: (genre = “talk”) AND ((day = “Saturday”) OR (day = “Sunday”)) | This answer uses both AND and OR to meet the required conditions. This is important because one has to happen and one is either or. | . Q6 . Q: Which of the following explains how the two databases can be used to develop the interactive exhibit? | A: Both databases are needed. Each database can be searched by animal name to find all information to be displayed. | Each database has part of the information needed, but not all of it, so they need to be combined in order to help the interactive exhibit work. | . Reflection . The usage of programs is very useful with databases. They help to be able to efficiently go through and get the data required. However, it is also essential to write good code which meets the requirements. It is also necessary to have a good understanding of the information the database can give you, in order to make sure you can get the most out of your code with good accuracy. .",

There were somethings which I was confused upon and I also determined that it is important to be focused while taking the test to cut down on silly mistakes. . . Test Corrections . I will go over questions which I was confused on. . Question 5 . This question was using flow charts and asking about a company. This company was using a new system for their customer service claims. . Question: Of the following potential benefits, which is LEAST likely to be provided by the upgraded system? | Correct Answer: The company will be able to provide a human representative for any incoming call. | My Answer: Customers are likely to spend less time listening to information not relevant to their issue. My answer was incorrect because the system would allow the customer to talk to the phone and then get directed. The customer would be spending less time listening to irrelevant information for sure. The company would not be able to provide a human rep for every call because they could not give a human rep for calls outside of business hours. | . I got this question wrong because I did not pay attention while reading the question. . Question 34 . . Answer Choices, Correct vs Wrong . . Why my answer was wrong: Instead of rotating right after moving forward twice, I said that the robot would need to move left. I got this answer wrong because I was not paying proper attention. I did not realize the correct path for the robot. I can check my answers and visualize the path of the robot better. | . Question 35 . . I got this question wrong because I was not paying attention to the algorithm created. My wrong answer would select the top score of B if scoreC &gt; scoreB &gt; scoreA. . . The correct answer checks every single score of the variables. This makes sure that every variable is checked. So, this will ensure that the correct score will be declared the maximum. . Question 36 . . I answered that code segment 2 would be the only one to be able to correctly satisfy the algorithm. I did not realize that III would have the same functionality. I did not pay attention and this caused me to get the question incorrect. . Question 49 . . I did not realize that one of the answer choices had one of the defining characteristics of a simulation. A scenario is a lower cost, safer, and simpler way to test things. The simulation will simplify things in order to be cheaper and run smoothly. Sometimes, they don’t need a lot of observations and the simulation runs well without observations. . Question 50 . . This question asked for 2 answers for the question. I mixed up the correct answer choices. I got this wrong because I mixed up the linear and non linear speeds. Linear speed is one which runs in a reasonable time. . Reflection . Based on my performance, I knew that I could’ve done better and scored higher. As we get closer to the AP test, it will be important to lock in and practice having a focused mindset for these collegeboard tests. I know a lot of the information, but I keep on making silly mistakes. It will be important to visualize the paths for things like the robot and pay attention to the answers and remember to apply all of my knowledge. If I practice these skills, I will be able to perform well on the Multiple Choice section of the collegeboard test. .",

Continue this Blog using Pandas extract info from that dataset (ex. max, min, mean, median, mode, etc.) | . Hack Helpers . Here is how Mort started on this assignment by asking ChatGPT ... Regarding Python Pandas, what are some data sets that would be good for learning Pandas? . There are many data sets that are suitable for learning pandas, depending on your interests and the skills you want to develop. Here are some suggestions:- Titanic Dataset: This is a classic dataset for data analysis and machine learning, and is often used as an introduction to pandas. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including their demographics, ticket class, and survival status. . Iris Dataset: This is another classic dataset that is often used in machine learning and data analysis courses. The dataset contains information about iris flowers, including their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. . | NBA Player Stats: This dataset contains information about NBA players, including their stats for various games, their positions, and their salaries. It is a great dataset for learning how to clean and manipulate data using pandas. . | Housing Prices Dataset: This dataset contains information about housing prices in a particular city or region, including variables such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and price. It is a great dataset for learning how to manipulate and analyze numerical data using pandas. . | COVID-19 Dataset: This dataset contains information about the COVID-19 pandemic, including the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries in various countries and regions. It is a great dataset for learning how to manipulate and analyze time-series data using pandas. . | World Bank Dataset: This dataset contains information about economic indicators from various countries, such as GDP, population, and poverty rates. It is a great dataset for learning how to manipulate and analyze large datasets using pandas. . | . | These are just a few examples of the many datasets that are suitable for learning pandas. The best dataset for you will depend on your interests and the specific skills you want to develop. . Follow up question, &quot;where can I find Titanic data set?&quot; . | The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning, and it can be found on various websites and data repositories. Here are a few places where you can find the Titanic dataset:- Kaggle: The Titanic dataset is available on Kaggle, which is a popular platform for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. You can download the dataset from the Kaggle website after creating an account. . UCI Machine Learning Repository: The Titanic dataset is also available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is a collection of datasets that are commonly used for machine learning research. You can download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website. . | Seaborn library: If you have the Seaborn library installed in your Python environment, you can load the Titanic dataset directly from the library using the following code: . import seaborn as sns titanic_data = sns.load_dataset(&#39;titanic&#39;) . | . | . Titanic Data . Look at a sample of data. . import seaborn as sns # Load the titanic dataset titanic_data = sns.load_dataset(&#39;titanic&#39;) print(&quot;Titanic Data&quot;) print(titanic_data.columns) # titanic data set print(titanic_data[[&#39;survived&#39;,&#39;pclass&#39;, &#39;sex&#39;, &#39;age&#39;, &#39;sibsp&#39;, &#39;parch&#39;, &#39;class&#39;, &#39;fare&#39;, &#39;embark_town&#39;]]) # look at selected columns . Use Pandas to clean the data. Most analysis, like Machine Learning or even Pandas in general like data to be in standardized format. This is called &#39;Training&#39; or &#39;Cleaning&#39; data. . # Preprocess the data from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder td = titanic_data td.drop([&#39;alive&#39;, &#39;who&#39;, &#39;adult_male&#39;, &#39;class&#39;, &#39;embark_town&#39;, &#39;deck&#39;], axis=1, inplace=True) td.dropna(inplace=True) td[&#39;sex&#39;] = td[&#39;sex&#39;].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == &#39;male&#39; else 0) td[&#39;alone&#39;] = td[&#39;alone&#39;].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == True else 0) # Encode categorical variables enc = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=&#39;ignore&#39;) enc.fit(td[[&#39;embarked&#39;]]) onehot = enc.transform(td[[&#39;embarked&#39;]]).toarray() cols = [&#39;embarked_&#39; + val for val in enc.categories_[0]] td[cols] = pd.DataFrame(onehot) td.drop([&#39;embarked&#39;], axis=1, inplace=True) td.dropna(inplace=True) print(td) . The result of &#39;Training&#39; data is making it easier to analyze or make conclusions. In looking at the Titanic, as you clean you would probably want to make assumptions on likely chance of survival. . This would involve analyzing various factors (such as age, gender, class, etc.) that may have affected a person&#39;s chances of survival, and using that information to make predictions about whether an individual would have survived or not. .

From Tutorials Point%20is,a%20consistence%20interface%20in%20Python). Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

My Hacks . Testing Pandas by myself . I have decided to use a csv file to get my data. This csv file has data from the top streamed songs on Spotify. . Spotify contains many songs of many different genres, so this provides a very large sample size. | There is not bias in data for the top streamed songs in the data, since this is numerical data. However, this does not represent the most popular songs of all time because songs released when Spotify was an app are more likely to be streamed on Spotify, rather than older songs. | The data set is maintained by a user on kaggle, so there does not need to be cleaning. | The purpose of this data set is to track the top streamed songs on Spotify. | . import pandas as pd streamdf = pd.read_csv(&#39;files/streams.csv&#39;) # using csv file for top streamed spotify songs topsong = streamdf.iloc[0] streams = streamdf[&quot;Streams (Billions)&quot;] meanstreams = streams.mean() topstreams = streamdf[streamdf[&quot;Streams (Billions)&quot;] &gt; 2.5] print(&quot;The top streamed song on Spotify is:&quot;) print(topsong) print(&quot; Break &quot;) print(&quot;The mean number of streams(in billions) of songs on this database:&quot;) print(meanstreams) print(&quot; Break &quot;) print(&quot;The songs with over 2.5 billion streams are:&quot;) print(topstreams) .

Then, we decided to change some of the properties inside the dataframe and add new columns. . from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder td = tips_data td[&#39;sex&#39;] = td[&#39;sex&#39;].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == &#39;Male&#39; else 0) td[&#39;time&#39;] = td[&#39;time&#39;].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == &#39;Dinner&#39; else 0) td[&#39;percentage&#39;] = (td[&#39;tip&#39;]/td[&#39;total_bill&#39;]) * 100 print(td.head()) . total_bill tip sex smoker day time size percentage 0 16.99 1.01 0 No Sun 0 2 5.944673 1 10.34 1.66 0 No Sun 0 3 16.054159 2 21.01 3.50 0 No Sun 0 3 16.658734 3 23.68 3.31 0 No Sun 0 2 13.978041 4 24.59 3.61 0 No Sun 0 4 14.680765 . We also used sklearn to create a plot and a linear regression line of the total bill vs the percentage tip given. Based on this, there appears to be a decreasing trend between cost of meal and the percentage of tip given. I learned that there are many ways to use dataframe data and they can help complete many tasks, from simple data storage to complex analysis. . from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression import matplotlib.pyplot as plt df = pd.DataFrame(td) model = LinearRegression() # fit the model to the data model.fit(df[[&#39;total_bill&#39;]], df[[&#39;percentage&#39;]]) # predict the y values using the model y_pred = model.predict(df[[&#39;total_bill&#39;]]) # plot the data and the regression line plt.scatter(df[&#39;total_bill&#39;], df[&#39;percentage&#39;]) plt.plot(df[&#39;total_bill&#39;], y_pred, color=&#39;red&#39;) plt.show() .",

Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ... . &quot;Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data&quot; | &quot;Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.&quot; | &quot;lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered&quot; | &quot;lossless data lets you restore and recover&quot; | . The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size . Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog. - Clouds Impression . Lassen Volcano | Green Square | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . Meta data is important because it helps store information. Meta data is important for storing information with images, like source. It is important to not have too much data to compress or this could cause images to be too big. . | File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab . | Size, height and width, number of pixels | Visual perception, lossy compression | . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . Introduction to displaying images in Jupyter notebook . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? Commands which we use in terminal to access files include cd, cat, ls. These all help us locate and read files. | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? I do not have too much experience with Windows because I have only used MacBooks. However, after some research, I learned that dir and cd are some commands which can be used with Windows to access files. | What are some of the major differences? Windows uses c:&quot;file path&quot; in order to find the file path, while Mac usually uses /. Additionally, Windows uses , while Linux and Mac use /. The letter in front of the file path generally represents the hard drive which the file is stored on. Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. | Why is path a big deal when working with images? Path is a big deal when working with images because it is important to have the right path or else the computer will not know which file or folder to access. | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? | . Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? IPython seems interesting because it allows Python to have a lot of capability. For example, IPython allows us to have an interactive shell which we can use for images. | . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;../images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? Base64 is similar to Binary and Hexadecimal because they are both different from the usual decimal. Base64 uses binary 1s and 0s in order to have conversions. Base64 uses binary to help convert text to binary. Base64 is more efficient than hexadecimal, which may be why it is used more. . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. Arn converts to QXJu in Base64. | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? I have been a consumer of buffering on sites like YouTube and news sites with many ads. I have always been a consumer of buffering when I have a lot of tabs open. | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? When my computer has buffering, things take time to load and my computer runs slowly. This is bad for the user because it makes them frustrated and less likely to use a website. | How do these effects apply to images? When I have buffering, images don&#39;t load up instantly, which can make the website look confusing and bad for the user. | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? This code looks like a series of steps are being performed to take the image, convert it to base64, and then turn it into grey scale. | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? The steps are that program loads up all the images. Then, the values of the pixels are averaged up to get a grey scale representation and then a new image is recreated based on the new averages. | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? Scale image allows the images to be resized. Before the pixels are their normal size, but now they are averaged up to be able to compress the images. | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Scaling an image is lossy compression. The quality of the file is reduced but the file size is also compressed. | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;../images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39;

            "content": "CSA Projects . I was able to see many cool projects from people who had much more experience coding than me. The CSA projects were very refined and combined both frontend and backend expertise to create a successful project. . . This project was meant to help create an inventory for a local car dealership. It was interesting to see how they interacted with real business owners to create a site which fit the needs of the business. . . This site was built to help students study better. It features interactive ways to be able to take notes and also presents useful resources and articles to students. It was interesting to see how fellow Nighthawk coders can work to help create their own solutions to the problems which are prevalent to many high schoolers, like studying tools. . Photography . . Through photography, I was able to see how we can capture interesting and significant moments of everyday lives. For example, one person was able to capture a beautiful picture of downtown at night on a day when a regular person would have seen it as a regular night. Additionally, different techniques can create meaningful photos. The contrast of the blue waves and the dark sky at the beach create a sense of fear and sadness, but also hope in the same photo. . Ceramics . . In Ceramics, I saw projects of people who had made teapots. It was interesting to see the creations of students and things which they could potentially use. Also, each student had their own ways of decorating their teapots. One student used yellow as their main color and then on the plate, they used yellow as a highlight and blue as the main color to create an intricate set. Another student created an almost galatic theme and colorway for their teapot, which showed how interesting it can be when colors are blended. . Reflections . I learned a lot about creativity through Night at the Museum. I saw how students were able to contribute to needs in society by using their skills to create websites which were easy to use. I also saw how photographers were able to capture specific moments in order to make a special picture out of an ordinary moment. I also saw how ceramics could be used to display various art patterns. . I think it would be interesting to make a more visually appealing and interesting site in the future, with more interaction and visibility for the user. This seems to draw more people in and could help them in a way. I could also consider seeing if any local businesses need help with a certain thing in order to contribute to my community. .",

The overall purpose of this program is to help football fans practice their knowledge of NFL statistics by playing a game to see which quarterback has the higher of a certain statistic. This helps people learn more about football and bring them a fun way to interact with player statistics. . ii . The video will show the user playing the game. The user will see player images pop up on screen and be able to select the player they think has more of a statistic. . iii . The video will show the user playing the game. In one case, the user will guess the correct player with the higher of a statistic. This will output a message of “Score +1” and increase the tracked score by one. In another case, the user will guess the wrong player with the lower of a random statistic. This will output a message of “Game Over” and reset the score back to 0. . Part b . . . i . The data from the API containing the players and their statistics is stored in a list. . ii . The second code segment shows the players and their statistics being randomly selected to be output onto the page for the user. . iii . List: players . iv . This represents the players and their data which are essential to the running of the game. . v . Without a list, there would have to be many individual variable for each player and their statistics. This would make put a lot of strain on the computer to iterate through long lists and would also make it hard for the program to be efficient. . Part c . . . i . The given procedure randomly selects the players who will be for the user to choose from. . ii . The program uses these players for the game. . iii . The identified features ensures that there are no repeat players and makes the game less buggy for the users. . iv . The algorithm works by first selecting two random players from the database in order to present to the user. Then, they are checked to make sure that they do not match. The code will then check for which player the user clicked on. If it is the one with more of the statistic, then they will get a point and continue the game. Otherwise, the user loses and the score resets to 0. . Part d . i . First call: Selecting the player which has more of a statistic | Second call: Selecting the player which has less of a statistic | . ii . First call: If the user will gain points from selecting the player with more | Second call: Seeing if the game will end if a player with less of statistic is selected | . iii . First call: The user will see a message saying that their score is increased and the score will get 1 more. | Second call: The user will see a message saying the game is over and the score is reset to 0. | . Scoring . Item Score Reasoning . Program Purpose | 1 | The response describes the function of the program well. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | The response shows a list being used in the program and talks about how data is abstracted. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | The response shows why a list is necessary and then talks about how much harder it would be without a list. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | The procedure could be more defined and there could be a better definition of the purpose. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | There is not much sequencing, selection, or iteration going on. The steps are not very detailed and it would be hard to reconstruct the algorithm. | . Testing | 0 | The response talks about two different general calls to the program. It does not have specific inputs to the program, thus losing the point. | .",

I answered C, that the loop would end up with the number 10 being displayed. However, I forgot to see that loop causes i to be reset to 1 every time, so it can never reach the value of 4. So the correct answer would be D, where the program loops forever. . Question 23 . I originally selected the answer of D, where the count would displayed after every iteration. I did not take into account that the flowchart showed that count would only be displayed if it was over 5, so the correct answer would be A, 5. . Question 25 . I selected the option that there would be an infinite loop if j=7, or the answer C. However, I missed the fact that j was initially 1, so that 2 would be added on every time to j. This meant that 7 would be a possible value for j, but 6 would not be. So, the correct answer would be j=6, or A. . Question 28 . I got this question wrong because I did not select two options. I was planning to originally select A and C because they both would get the robot to the gray square, but I think I forget to select A. It is important to pay attention to my answers. . Question 32 . I originally selected A for this problem, saying that only program 1 would get the correct answer. However, both programs would get the right answer for the question. I did not realize that the second program segment would add 1 to the program for every 1 in n(1 for 1, 2 for 2, 3 for 3, etc), and then would subtract 1 from n every time. So, this would end up yielding the same result as the other algorithm. This means that C, where both programs work, would be correct. . Question 45 . Heuristic: In coding, getting a solution by trial and error, with loosely defined rules | . I did not know what heuristic meant, so this taught me a new word. After going over the meaning, I realized that this is good when you cannot get the specific solution to a problem, but can get an approximate one. I originally answered that a heuristic approach would be good for a problem when it could be solved in reasonable time and an approximate solution is needed(A). However, you could solve this by just finding the exact solution, and don’t need trial and error. However, if you don’t know how long it will take for a solution to be found, you can use trial and error(a heuristic approach) to get an approximate solution. So, the answer would be C. . Reflection . I felt like a lot of my mistakes where things which I knew, I just had not checked over my work or problem properly. So, I should keep in mind to check over my answers carefully and to read the questions and diagrams carefully in order to ensure my success. .",

Video games and social media can be good ways for us to connect with our friends, have fun, and take a break from life, but it is important to have balance in life. If we let video games and social media control our life, we will not be able to live out the other experiences in life. While these forms of enjoyment can be useful, it is important to remember that there are many facets of life and many things to enjoy. So, it is important to participate in activities outdoors. With many | 5.2 Digital Divide . In a digital world, you can empower yourself by using technology and learning about technology. There are many facets to technology, from hardware to software. There are many avenues to be able to learn, as even if one does not have access to technology, libraries and schools may have computers to use technology and empower people. Additionally, even when people have access to some technology, libraries can give access to more complex technology, like 3-D printers. | To help others who are not empowered with technology, people with technology can do things to empower others. For example, if an empowered individual got a new laptop, they could donate their old laptop to those who do not have as much technology. Something we could do at Del Norte is organize volunteering to help teach students about technology and be able to contribute to efforts which would allow people to have a greater access to technology. | Paper and red tape can block digital empowerment if it used full time. Before COVID, very few of my classes used computers on a daily basis. After COVID, pretty much all of my classes used computers. There are some barriers to digital empowerment if classes constantly use paper or red tape. However, if classes mix both computers and paper lessons and work, it will be beneficial to improving digital empowerment. While it is important to retain and build skills with both paper and the digital world, has they both give students the option to learn in their preferred method, focusing too much on one could be harmful. | Questions From Canvas . I think my project will have some beneficial impacts. Educate people about sports | Help me and my team learn more about coding | Entertain users with interactive site Potential Harms: | If not updated frequently, the website could provide incorrect statistics | . | Pros of Internet Blocker: Ensures that students go on school friendly sites | Helps students pay attention during school by blocking certain sites and social medias Cons of Internet Blockers: | Some sites for research are not able to be used | Some Computer Science sites are not available because they haven’t been verified | Harder for students to be able to study everything at school | . | With the digital divide, it can be harder for people without access to technology to be able to have access to the newest advancements and news on their devices. This would put these people at a disadvantage when trying to get into jobs or schools. Additionally, with lots of of complex technology, it could be very hard to be able to know everything. So, we would spend more and more time on our computers, which can be bad for our health and cause people to get more and more distracted. | 5.3 Computing Bias . Different programs have different purposes, so there are different algorithms to do different things. It can be harmful for apps to have a certain audience because they want to focus on having as much attention as possible, so they can end up being addictive. | Virtual assistants may have inherent bias because we usually view that women’s voices are more comforting to a person. | Algorithms from TikTok can be meant to keep the user on the app for as long as possible. | I think the HP bias was unintentional. The owner of the computer may have thought of it as intentional. However, there were probably biases within the testing algorithm because they may not have sampled as many black or dark-skinned people. This is harmful not only for the user, but also for the company, since they will be marked racist. It is important to be able to have a diversity on user testing because it will be necessary for companies to be accommodating of a variety of users, which will benefit both the consumer and the company. | . 5.4 Crowdsourcing . In CSP, with a wide variety of students in the class, we are lucky to be able to have lots of different viewpoints. This will help us develop code which is more accommodating of all people. A crowdsourcing idea which I have for CSP is creating an open source code repository for people to edit. This can be a copy of my own repository, and with the advice of many students, I will be able to see different ways to make my code more efficient. I could initiate this by advertising this during class or on Slack in order to be able to communicate with other students to inform them of the open source code. | A crowdsourcing idea which I have is by having a form to be able take in consumer input on my Create Performance Task site. This would be able to be requested by anyone on Del Norte and they would answer questions about how they like my program and what could be done to improve it. I would do this because I would be able to get a lot of information about how to better meet the needs of the consumer. This will allow me to see viewpoints I did not see and have an overall better functioning program. | At Night at the Museum, it would probably be best to supply a form which will allow people to provide their input on my program. I will have a form link at the end of my higher or lower game in order to get user input. I would probably asked for the rating of the game and also add comments or features which they believe they could improve the program. I could create a graph representing the rating of my program and also make outlines and potentially change my code to incorporate the user input into my program. | . 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns .

I have seen lots of PII used in GitHub projects. I have seen examples of people using names, phone numbers, emails, and usernames for projects. | I think PII is important for being able to see information about a specific person. Everyone has their own information which makes them unique, like their awards and special hobbies and these can be shared online on a place like LinkedIn to further careers. Things like phone numbers and addresses are also available, but if they are in the wrong hands, they can be detrimental to people. Things like SSNs and bank numbers should not be in the hands of other people because they are very important to our lives. | Good passwords are ones which are long and have a variety of symbols, numbers, and letters(upper and lowercase). Bad passwords are simple and reused. To authenticate passwords, websites can have checks on passwords to meet certain length and complexity requirements. Additionally, users may be able to download a program which tells them if one of their passwords is too similar to another one. | Symmetric Encryption: When a single key is used to encrypt and decrypt data | Asymmetric encryption: When one key is used to encrypt data and another one is used to decrypt the data | One example of how we use encryption through AWS is how our repositories use SSH keys. These allow us to encrypt data for our repositiories. | Phishing schemes which I have learned about the hard way are ones where they slightly change the link of a website to look like they are the regular website, but are actually not. Other potential ways of phishing could be emails where someone impersonates a company or person or phone calls. It is important to pay attention to the details to determine if a call, email, or website is a scam. | .",

However, Collegeboard found that the code in the second code segment was not meeting requirements. The actual values in the list were not being used, only the length of the list. | Managing Complexity: The list which was used in the program did not actually show storage and usage of the values in the list, it only used data based on the length of the list. This did not meet the Collegeboard requirements. | Testing: I thought that testing the multiple outcomes would meet the standards. Collegeboard wanted specific requirements, that included testing specific arguments, not just getting different outcomes. So, they deemed this program would not receive the point. | . Things to Remember . Specificity: It is important to make sure that the program meets the specific requirements of Collegeboard. Based on these examples, I have learned that Collegeboard is very concise on what they want to see. Testing or writing about things which are too broad will not earn me the point. | Correctness: Collegeboard looks to make sure that all parts of the written response accurately describe the methods of code. They will take points away if the response has something about the incorrect functionality of code, so it will be important to proofread the explanation. | Planning: I think it will be very important to plan out how a program will be able to meet the requirements of the Collegeboard Create Performance Task in order to create an efficient and high scoring project. It will be important to take into consideration the many things which Collegeboard looks for. | .",

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Binary Numbers | Represent with 0s and 1s | . Unsigned Integer | Does not have a plus or minus indicator in front of the value | . Signed Integer | Has a plus or minus sign in front of a value | . Floating Point | Can be a positive or negative decimal | . Binary Data Abstractions | Binary can be used to simplify the values of many things, from numbers, to whether a computer is on or off. Binary Data Abstraction makes it possible for computers to understand our inputs. | . Boolean | Variable which has a value of either True or False | . ASCII | American Standard Code for Information Interchange, encodes data for communication, allows a multitude of symbols to be represented | . Unicode | System used to store and process text data | . RGB | red, green, blue color model, can use data values to represent colors | . Data Compression | reducing the number of bits to represent data, makes things cheaper | . Lossy | a file which is removed or not restored after data compression has been reversed | . Lossless | when all files are restores or rebuilt after data compression has been reversed | . Variable | Stores a value in a data set, there are multiple data types | . Data Types | types of data, include string(letters/words), integers(numbers), boolean(T/F), float(decimals) | . Assignment operators | operators which assign a variable a value, usually = | . Lists | able to store multiple data points in one variable, can be iterated through | . 2D Lists | lists which store multiple lists, can be used to represent matrices | . Dictionaries | Similar to a list, except stores key value pairs which can be called | . Class | give blueprints for creating a data structure, store objects | . Algorithm | Sequences of code which allow certain tasks to be completed | . Sequence | The order in which a code is written | . Selection | Selecting a certain code segment, can be based on conditions | . Iteration | Going through a data set or repeating a step a certain number of times | . Expression | combinations of statements | . Comparison Operators | Operators which compare two values, can be less than, equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to | . Boolean Expressions and Selection | Boolean Expressions are expressions based on True or False conditions, selection of a sequence can result if a boolean expression is true or false | . Boolean Expressions and Iteration | A sequence of code or list/dictionary can be iterated through if there is a certain condition met | . Truth Tables | Tables which represent the results of operators like and, or, not, xor | . Characters | the individual indices of a string | .

Concatenation | taking parts of string using a function | . Upper | makes all letters of a string uppercase | . Lower | makes all letters of a string lowercase | . Traversing Strings | first character of string will be stored at 0, the 2nd character will be stored at 1, etc. | . Python If | will go through a code statement if a conditional is met | . Python Elif | will go through a code statement if a previous conditional is met, and a different one is | . Python Else Conditional | will go through a code statement if no conditional is met | .

Hack 1 . A decidable problem is one which an algorithm will be able to solve no matter the input. An undecidable problem is one where it is not possible for any algorithm to come to a correct solution. Sometimes, an undecidable problem can have some parts solved by an algorithm, but for a problem to be decidable, it must have all parts solved by an algorithm. . Hack 2 . Answer: C. (3x8)^2 | This is correct because it is features 2 integers being multiplied together and then raised to the power of 2. | . Hack 3 . Explanation for Code: Defines a function to find a peak, and goes through each item, and checks if it is greater than the stored value. . | Why this is more efficient: This uses much less code and will work for all lists.

Hack 4 . Explanation for Code: This code defines a list, which has the numbers. Then, it redefines the list of numbers, using the function in Python called sorted. This automatically sorts the data in order from lowest to highest. . | Why this is more efficient: This is a much smaller piece of code, making it much easier to write and understand.

Question 4 . See image . Question 5 . To select the number 69, you must go through binary search. First, you must find the middle value by adding the first(1) and last index(8) value and dividing by 2. Since that value is a decimal(3.5), round up(4), and the element is 6. | This is not the intended value, so take each half of the list, before the middle and after the middle and repeat binary search. Repeating this process for the first half finds a middle value of that portion(1+4/2 = 2.5, round to index 3, whose element has a value of 3). For the back half of the list, we repeat this value, with the 6-8th elements, selecting index 7, which has a value of 11. | Since the value of 69 is not found, we must repeat the binary search process. Now, the back half only has the endpoints to be checked, indices 6 and 8. Index 6 is 9, which is not the intended value, but index 8 is the intended value of 69. | . Question 6 . See image . Question 7 . An order that can be used for binary search is: . [&quot;Market&quot;, &quot;Ralphs&quot;, &quot;store&quot;, &quot;Target&quot;, &quot;Walmart&quot;] This is because the strings are in alphabetical order, which would make sense. | . Question 8 . Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because binary search allows the computer to check exponentially more numbers each search. A binary search algorithm keeps on multiplying the amount of numbers checked by 2 each time. The sequential search checks each element individually, which will probably take a longer time, since the algorithm must go through every item of a list. . Question 9 . See image . To find the number 36, it would take 2 checks. The middle value on the first check would be 16, the 3rd index((1+5)/2). Then, we take the parts of the list on each side of the middle element. Before 16 are 64 and 36, while after 16 are 11 and 9. For the first part of the list there are 2 indices, 1 and 2. Using the binary search formula, (1+2)/2 = 1.5, which rounds up to the element at index 2, which is 36, the designated value. . def binary_search(list, value): bottom = 0 top = len(list) - 1 mid = 0 while bottom &lt;= top: mid = (bottom + top) // 2 if list[mid] &lt; value: bottom = mid + 1 elif list[mid] &gt; value: top = mid - 1 else: return mid return -1 numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] x = 4 test = binary_search(numbers, x) if test != -1: print(&quot;Element&quot;, str(x), &quot;is present at index&quot;, str(test)) else: print(&quot;Element is not present in array&quot;) .

Using libraries will allow coding to be much easier, and use work that has already been developed. Documentation makes it easy for someone to read my code, and many programs have a documentation which outlines usage for the users. The random library is used very frequently in Python programming. Randomization can be very useful in programs. A lot of programs which we see use randomization, such as games or websites. . Notes .

Short Answer Questions . Using libraries allows users to access and reuse pre-written code. This allows algorithms to be made more efficient. Additionally, there are many libraries which are created for multiple different purposes, which makes it easier for programmers to create more complex algorithms. | First, the code segment imports the random library for use. Then, the program takes in names from user input, and puts them into a list(names). Then, the variable num_items finds the length of the list of names. The random_choice variable generates a random number which will be an index of the list. random_choice makes use of the random.randint function and generates a value from 0 to the maximum index(length of list minus 1). Then the program finds the person who is associated with the randomly generated value. Finally, the program prints that individual&#39;s name. | import random # takes user input, puts it into a list of names names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, seperated by a comma.&quot;) names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) num_items = len(names) # uses random to choose a random number random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) # associates random number with a name person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] # prints name print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) .

[&#39;Josh&#39;, &#39;Jared&#39;, &#39;McCorkle&#39;, &#39;Jalen&#39;, &#39;Dak&#39;] . Documentation . This program generates 5 random names from a list. A list of names is predefined, as well as another empty list for the names to be put into. The function addPeople is defined for the sequence of code. It establishes a counter variable, which allows for 5 names to be appended to using a while loop, as the program runs while the counter variable is under a certain value. A random number is generated using the random.randint function, which generates a random integer from 0 to 1 less than the length of the list. This makes sure that when it calls the index to append into the new list, the index values fall in the range of the list of full names. Finally, the program returns the new list. .

Player 1 won with a score of 8 points! Both players tied with 9 points! . Documentation . The function must import the random library in order to replicate rolling a pair of dice. 2 variables are defined at first. Then, a function is created to represent the dice game. To give each player a score, the random.randint function is called twice, adding both random numbers to each other and storing that value. The random.randint function runs from 1 to 6, which represents a dice rolling a number from 1 to 6 equally. This is repeated for both players. Then, the scores are compared. If both scores are equal, a message is printed stating there is a tie. If one player has more points than the other, a statement saying that player with more points won is printed. . Extra .

Procedures are important in many coding languages, and having efficient names for them will be key, especially when there is a long program. Procedures also have arguments which allow different arguments to be called. Moving robots can be challenging, as it can be hard to visualize and describe the specific rotations it would take. The nature of direction makes it much easier for us to do, but very hard for us to describe and instruct upon. I had some challenges with the robot moving problems, but with lots of practice, I can achieve mastery. .",

When naming a variable, it is important to make it simple and not too long, for ease of use and calling in a program. We can store different types of values in the variable, like an integer, string, boolean, or float. When calling variable, the value stored in the variable will be the same as the most recent definition of the variable above the call.

Skill 3.A - Generalize data sources through variables. Skill 3.C - Explain how abstraction manages complexity. Skill 4.A - Explain how a code segment or program functions. Skill 4.C - Identify and correct errors in algorithms and programs, including error discovery through testing. . Question 8 . My Answer: A Correct Answer: B . I thought that the index started at 0, and forgot that the code would not work if j or k were values greater than the length of numList. . Question 11 . My Answer: D Correct Answer: B . I did not pay enough attention to the question, and did not notice that the if statement iterates until k is greater than myList. This means that the function will check through all elements. . Question 14 . My Answer: A Correct Answer: B . If 7 is run through command, “check” will be displayed. However, 6 also displays “check”, which is incorrect. . Question 30 . My Answer: A Correct Answer: B . Using a list makes it easier to apply the same procedure to all the items in the list. . Question 39 . My Answer: A Correct Answer: B . Silly mistake, thought question was asking for potential item. . . Reflection . After taking this test, I now know have a better idea of what to focus on when taking multiple choice tests. I should pay a greater amount of attention when answering questions, and always be sure to read the question carefully. Doing this will be able to cut down on some mistakes. I also have to remember the exam will be in psuedo-code, so there may be terms which I need to familiarize myself with. Overall, my score was pretty good(45/50), but by paying more attention and brushing up on a few skills, I can reduce the number of errors which I make. .",

We observed a lot of different websites from both the AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A classes. For example, we saw an APCSA project which had a random song generator. We also saw an NBA statistics site, as well as a game of Hangman. . Animation . Looking through the 3D Animation class, we saw many interesting projects. They featured lots of donuts, but each student had their own distinct donut and background. It was really interesting. . . Art . Art is definitely something I struggle with, but I saw really cool art pieces at Night at the Museum. There were many different styles of art, and they all looked really good. . . Some were pencil drawings, some were colored pencil, and some were paintings. . . Ceramics . Ceramics had many cool products to show at Night at the Museum. While creating the art may have been frustrating, the finished projects are very nice showpieces. . . Project Ideas . Night at the Museum is a great place for creativity. There were many fantastic works which could be used as inspiration. Some ideas for future projects could be an NFL stat tracker, a random image generator, or a website that classifies architecture of different cities or areas. .",

Here are a couple screenshots of the issues that we made that show our progress in our final project: . . Scrumboard also helps us maintain an interactive to do list. We can constantly move tasks based on their status in the project. . . . Wireframe . We also made wireframes using Canva to plan out our project and also design our website before actually making it. It helped prevent errors and problems by fixing and thinking everything through beforehand. We designed all our pages through the wireframme before coding for it in VSCode. . . Problems . We did run into a few problems while making our final project. . One of our problems was formatting the website’s background We had to make it so that the aspect ratio was applicable to any screen size | Some computers showed the background being cut off | . | Another problem we had was getting our API to work At first, we couldn’t extract the questions from our URL and we couldn’t access the JSON file | After we figured that out, we couldn’t figure out how to call the backend code for API in the frontend | . | . . Progress . We have made considerable progress in our final project. . This first screenshot shows the homepage for our final project website, named Practice Nexus. We have cards for our two quizzes, a math quiz and a geography quiz. The page is also designed with different colors and images, with a navigation bar to access different parts of the website. . . This second screenshot shows the about us page for our final project website. The page introduces all the team members with the following information: . Role - Scrum Master, Frontend, Backend, DevOps | Age/Grade | Favorite things to do | Link to fastpages | . . This final screenshot shows us implementing the API we selected. We are able to get the question, and 4 answer choices from the json file. We still need to work on a way for the user to see if they are correct or not . . We stil have to finish up some designing. Once we do that, we also have to design each individual quiz page so that one question pops up at a time and answer choices can be selected. We might also include a scoring page, where we keep track of how many questions the user got right/wrong. . We plan to finish this by our design by splitting up the work while also keeping track of everyone else’s work and posting any problems/issues. Backend developers - Tay and Luke - will work on coding for scores and also make/use API to get the questions into the Frontend | Frontend developers - Adi and I - will implement the API and use it to get questions into the quiz pages.

The program will take the user’s notes and, based on it, select the key terms and output multiple quiz questions which will be displayed randomly. It will score the quiz and tell you what you got wrong and what you need to study on. | . Data Abstraction . The program will contain lists and dictionaries.

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language.

Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. . In the Nighthawk Coders APCSP you can find an Overview and Examples using APIs:APCSP APIs menu- Using Covid RapidAPI JavaScript frontend API code in APCSP Fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-rapidapi.md | . | Making a Jokes API (this will next API tech talk) Frontend.

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",

FYI, related tests could be in same Issue by using markdown checkboxes to separate tests. | . | . Hacks . Some errors which may arise in our project could be how we would store user inputs for a certain user. Storing this could be a challenge, so we would probably need to test that out. | Some test cases could be testing user input and how the user would be displayed. We could test user storage by listing out a list of users. We could also test storing of questions and answers. We could do this by having a page which shows the list of questions and answers a user has. | We can document bugs on the scrumboard and how we solved the problem. | Single tests will be very useful for testing small features. We can use this as we add pieces of the program together, and then get a large, successful project. | Things we can use single tests for: storing user input, repeating code segments which loop, and deploying the site. | .

PBL - Project Based Learning is an inquiry-based instructional approach, in a real-world context, where students generate the pathways and products that meet defined, standards-based outcomes | Project - Time frame in which your culminating product is developed through workshops and deliverables | Culminating Project - Compilation of deliverables derived from the Deconstructed TEKS that come together to create a final presentation/demonstration of what was learned throughout the project | Driving Questions - Helps to initiate and focus the inquiry. It also captures and communicates the purpose of the project in a succinct question. It creates interest and a feeling of challenge. It guides the project work. It helps student answer the question: “Why are we doing this?” | Enduring Understanding - Refers to the important ideas or CORE processes that are central to a discipline and transferable to new situations and that have lasting value BEYOND the classroom… Learning should be measured in YEARS. “30 hours vs. 30 days vs. 30 years” | Entry Launch - The engaging activity that kickstarts your PBL. | Entry Document - The document used to drive the project, connect the TEKS to the idea, and develop the KNOW/K2K. Can be delivered in multiple formats. | Checkpoints - Scheduled mini-presentations held throughout the project to allow for formative assessment, positive &amp; negative feedback, whole group collaboration, accountability, speaking practice, and progression toward project completion. These develop 21st Century Skills and reinforce the focus on the enduring understanding, driving question, and culminating product. | Facilitating Questions - Appropriate way that teachers use to guide students toward the enduring understanding/deliverable/goal, redirect students, “pull out” content vocabulary, or help students make connections (conceptual, cross-discipline, relevance, value). Open ended is most effective, but close ended, probing techniques are acceptable for scaffolding. | Workshops - Planned lessons that are listed for students in a checklist or added assessments indicate. Commonly held in small groups to meet the need of the student(s) or group(s). | Deliverable - “End result” or goal of a workshop that will directly be used for the realization of the culminating product. It can be knowledge, but it is typically something that will be presented, built upon, or used to achieve the project’s desired result. | .",

Sleep by 11:00 everyday | Practice my instrument for at least 30 minutes each day | Work on college applications for at least 30 minutes each day | Minimize homework on the weekend(less specific) | . Goals can help us feel more organized, even we have a lot on our plate. This will help reduce stress levels in us. Especially with college application season, I think creating a list of small and specific goals related to applications will allow me to be less stressed, feel more in control, and be happier. .",

We will create an introduction page, and have a 3 quesiton quiz. The intro page will have a button which allows the user to go to the next question, as well as an image related to the quiz. . We plan to have our quiz be about Del Norte High School, so it could provide some uses to Del Norte students. Potential topics for quiz questions could be: . What is our mascot? | What classes are offered at DNHS? | Who is our principal? | What time does school start? | What time does school end? | When are late start days? | . Each question will have 4 answer choices, with an image or button corresponding to answer choices. If the user clicks on the button corresponding to the right answer, they will be taken to a “correct screen.” If the user gets the question wrong(clicks on an incorrect answer choice), they will be taken to an “incorrect page.” . On each “correct screen”, we plan to have an image which showcases an image of validation, and a button for the next question. On each “incorrect page”, we would have the opposite of the “correct screen”, but still a button for the next question. . After the user answers all the questions, we will take them to a final screen, which could show their score or take them to the beginning of the quiz if they want to retake it. . Plan of Screens: Home Screen -&gt; Question 1 Screen -&gt; Correct/Wrong Screen -&gt; Question 2 Screen -&gt; Correct/Wrong Screen -&gt; Question 3 Screen -&gt; Correct/Wrong Screen -&gt; Final Screen . Our Code . We utilized a lot of onEvent statements in our code, as they would let us know if a specific button has been clicked. . . Additionally, to get a score, we defined a variable and added to it every time the user selected a correct answer. . We created a variable results box, which is varied due to the display of the score. We did this since each user would have a different score. . . The playSound button adds a fun little twist, as it plays custom audio to the user after completion of the quiz. . We often looked at the code in the text form to help us build familiarity with Javascript. The debug console also helped us a lot in figuring out our mistakes, and we will use it a lot in future projects. We wonder if the debug console can be used in other languages, like Python. . The Quiz. . Here is the link to our quiz. . Our Experience . Successes, Discoveries, and Challenges . We created a quiz which was able to track the score of the user. We had some challenges defining a variable to store the score, since the syntax is different from python. We realized that we had to define the variable, and then add to it using different syntax. This is different from python because python allows the coder to keep on redefining a variable. . We also had some trouble with formatting, and centering the images and items on the screen. We learned about the pixel dimensions of the screen(it is 320 x 450 px!) We then had to use dimensions of other items on the screen to help us center the images. It was also interesting to see how the positioning system works. . What We Learned . Using AppLab was a very cool experience. It really helped us learn more about Javascript, with an easy to use interface. We liked using the blocks, but the ability to check out the code in true Javascript helped us see basic Javascript programming. This project helped us learn about user interaction and how Javascript is a powerful language for that. . We also got a preview of how to use images in Javascript. We saw the positioning system, but there still a lot to learn about how to call the shapes in real code. . Extra Project . We decided to test out other features in App Lab. We did this by creating a simple game of tic tac toe. We learned about defining variables, altering images, and even adding sound! The program allows two users to play a game of tic tac toe, and allows the user the option to reset the scoreboard without restarting the app. We also continued practicing Javascript, and using the debug console as a way to help us see where our code was going wrong.

The boxes which are around the articles seem to not have been there(with minima), and I don’t know if that was supposed to happen when changing the theme to Merlot. The preview images were very large, instead of the small ones which minima has. Also, the GitHub user button did not seem to work. It can be seen that minima is the optimized theme for Fastpages. . Customizing the Fastpage Site . I experimented with dark mode on the site, as well as changing the color of dark mode from black to a different color. It is a neat way to customize the site, but I think I will stick with the regular dark mode for now. . . Time Box Fragments . I have created a time box on the frontpage describing what I have done for the week, and linked the review ticket. . Naming and Tagging . Naming and tagging are very useful on the blog to organize material. Using the tagging feature, I have been able to organize my posts and notebooks based on the language, the subject they are for, and they week they were posted. . . Using the Searchbar . The search bar is also a powerful tool for this blog. It helps to find posts with keywords, but it also finds posts with certain tags. In the image, I was easily able to search for posts with the “week0” tag. . . Changing _config.yml . I had originally changed the config file to show the preview images, which the site did not do before. I changed show_image: to true and this allows for a different, more interesting format. . Using Liquid . I learned that liquid could make creating the time box easier. Liquid has the capability of “incrememnting” variables, or adding one each time the variable is called.

[{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;John&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Mortensen&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;October 21&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;jmortensen@powayusd.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;2015-Fusion&#39;, &#39;2011-Ranger&#39;, &#39;2003-Excursion&#39;, &#39;1997-F350&#39;, &#39;1969-Cadillac&#39;]}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Sunny&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Naidu&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;August 2&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;Temecula&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;snaidu@powayusd.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;4Runner&#39;]}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Arnav&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Kanekar&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;July 3&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;**********@*****.***&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: &#39;None&#39;}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;John&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Cena&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;April 23&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;Tampa&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;johncena@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: &#39;2006 Ford GT, 1970 Plymouth Superbird&#39;}] . For Loops . Using a for loop to iterate through a list. . sports = [&quot;football&quot;, &quot;track&quot;, &quot;soccer&quot;, &quot;basketball&quot;, &quot;tennis&quot;] # list # iterates based on the range, so in this case it will only iterate 5 times for i in range(5): print(sports[i]) # would not print more than 5 sports, even if list is longer . football track soccer basketball tennis . For Loop with an Index . Creating a list and using a for loop with indexes to print it. This iterates for every index in the list, making it more powerful and easier to code with. . cake_flavors = [&quot;chocolate&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;vanilla&quot;] # List # For loop, for index in list for i in cake_flavors: print(i) # Print the flavor . chocolate strawberry vanilla . Using the While Loop and Inputs . This demonstrates usage of the while loop. The while loop calls a function as long as a certain condition is met. This is also another example of creating dictionaries using inputs. . meals = {} # empty dictionary length = 4 # runs as long as there are less than 4 items in the dictionary while len(meals) &lt; length: name = input(&quot;Name a food.&quot;) rating = input(&quot;How would you rate the meal on a scale of 1 - 10?&quot;) meals[name] = rating # determines the key and the value print(meals) . {&#39;pineapple pizza&#39;: &#39;5&#39;, &#39;chicken alfredo&#39;: &#39;8&#39;, &#39;fried chicken&#39;: &#39;10&#39;, &#39;mango&#39;: &#39;9&#39;} . Recursion . Recursive functions are helpful, but can be inefficient since it keeps on recalling the function. . def factorial(i): # defining the function if i == 0: # will not recall function return 1 if i == 1: # will not recall function return i if i != 1: return i * factorial(i - 1) # recalls the function, but at lesser value print(factorial(5)) print(factorial(0)) print(factorial(1)) . 120 1 1 . Tools . Using other capabilities to organize lists. These are very useful tools. . Reverse Order . Command to output a list in reverse order. . countdown = [3, 2, 1] # New list print(countdown) countdown.reverse() # Reversing the list print(countdown) . [3, 2, 1] [1, 2, 3] . This shows that the .reverse() statement is used to reverse a list. . Sort and Set . More functions that can help to alphabetize lists as well as make sure there are no duplicates in the list. . cake_flavors = [&quot;chocolate&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;vanilla&quot;] # Appending multiple items cake_flavors.append(&quot;red velvet&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;lemon&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;marble&quot;) print(cake_flavors) # Printing the new list # Sort function cake_flavors.sort() print(cake_flavors) # Alphabetized list # Appending more flavors cake_flavors.append(&quot;lemon&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;german chocolate&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;carrot&quot;) print(cake_flavors) cake_flavors = set(cake_flavors) print(cake_flavors) . [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;, &#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;] [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;, &#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;] [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;, &#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;german chocolate&#39;, &#39;carrot&#39;] {&#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;carrot&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;, &#39;german chocolate&#39;, &#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;} . Showcases the .append(), .sort(), and set(). Append adds a new item to the list, sort puts the list in alphabetical order, and set removes any duplicatte items. . Quiz . Creating a quiz like last week, except using a list of dictionaries. This makes it easier to store questions and answers as key and value pairs. . quiz = [] # empty list #variables question_count = 5 score = 0 # appending some questions quiz.append({ &quot;What type of language is Python&quot; : &quot;object oriented&quot;, &quot;How do you get an output in Python?&quot; : &quot;print&quot; }) quiz.append({ &quot;Is a dictionary a primitive or a collection?&quot; : &quot;collection&quot;, &quot;How do you add more information to a list?&quot; : &quot;append&quot;, &quot;What do you need to call to get the value in a dictionary?&quot; : &quot;key&quot; }) # function to print questions and get answers def questioning(ask): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + ask) global ans ans = input() print(&quot;Answer: &quot; + ans) # for loop to iterate through the dictionary for dict in quiz: for question, answer in dict.items(): # for the key and value pair questioning(question) # calling function if ans.lower() == answer: score += 1 print(&quot;Your answer is correct.&quot;) else: print(&quot;You are incorrect.&quot;) # percentage calculator from last time def grade(sco, quests): percent = 100 * float(sco)/float(quests) return percent quiz_percentage = grade(score, question_count) # Defining variable print(&quot;You got &quot; + str(score) + &quot; of &quot; + str(question_count) + &quot; questions correct.&quot;) print(&quot;Your score is &quot; + str(quiz_percentage) + &quot;%.&quot;) . Question: What type of language is Python Answer: OBJECT ORiented Your answer is correct. Question: How do you get an output in Python? Answer: pRINT Your answer is correct. Question: Is a dictionary a primitive or a collection? Answer: primitive You are incorrect. Question: How do you add more information to a list? Answer: APPEnd Your answer is correct. Question: What do you need to call to get the value in a dictionary? Answer: kEY Your answer is correct. You got 4 of 5 questions correct. Your score is 80.0%. .",

Finding the secrets of .git! . Learning about bash was really interesting to see the many things it can show the user. It looks like it can be a very helpful tool. . Hacks . Is there anything we use to verify tools we install? Think about versions. . Using the bash script, we can use --version option for each of the tools to verify which version of the tool is installed. For example, executing the command python --version in bash will give us the version of python the user has installed. This helps to verify the tool that has been set up, and tells the version, so the user can know if they want to update it. Also, we can use conda list to check the programs and their versions. . Is there anything we could verify with Anaconda? . Using conda list, we can verify the programs installed. This is also useful to see what version of the program is installed. . How would you update a repository? . To update a remote repository with changes made to the local repository, we can use git push to push changes from a local repository to the remote repository. To update a local repository with changes made to the remote repository, we use git pull to pull the changes from the remote repository to the local repository. Additionally, git add and git commit are used to stage and commit changes. . Really cool would be automating a procedure from installation. . This can be done by writing and running programs using the Shell Script. .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
