            "content": "Enumerate &quot;Data&quot; Big Idea from College Board . Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ... . &quot;Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data&quot; | &quot;Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.&quot; | &quot;lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered&quot; | &quot;lossless data lets you restore and recover&quot; | . The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size . Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog. - Clouds Impression . Lassen Volcano | Green Square | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . Meta data is important because it helps store information. Meta data is important for storing information with images, like source. It is important to not have too much data to compress or this could cause images to be too big. . | File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab . | Size, height and width, number of pixels | Visual perception, lossy compression | . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . Introduction to displaying images in Jupyter notebook . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? Commands which we use in terminal to access files include cd, cat, ls. These all help us locate and read files. | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? I do not have too much experience with Windows because I have only used MacBooks. However, after some research, I learned that dir and cd are some commands which can be used with Windows to access files. | What are some of the major differences? Windows uses c:&quot;file path&quot; in order to find the file path, while Mac usually uses /. Additionally, Windows uses , while Linux and Mac use /. The letter in front of the file path generally represents the hard drive which the file is stored on. Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. | Why is path a big deal when working with images? Path is a big deal when working with images because it is important to have the right path or else the computer will not know which file or folder to access. | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? | . Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? IPython seems interesting because it allows Python to have a lot of capability. For example, IPython allows us to have an interactive shell which we can use for images. | . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;../images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? Base64 is similar to Binary and Hexadecimal because they are both different from the usual decimal. Base64 uses binary 1s and 0s in order to have conversions. Base64 uses binary to help convert text to binary. Base64 is more efficient than hexadecimal, which may be why it is used more. . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. Arn converts to QXJu in Base64. | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? I have been a consumer of buffering on sites like YouTube and news sites with many ads. I have always been a consumer of buffering when I have a lot of tabs open. | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? When my computer has buffering, things take time to load and my computer runs slowly. This is bad for the user because it makes them frustrated and less likely to use a website. | How do these effects apply to images? When I have buffering, images don&#39;t load up instantly, which can make the website look confusing and bad for the user. | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? This code looks like a series of steps are being performed to take the image, convert it to base64, and then turn it into grey scale. | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? The steps are that program loads up all the images. Then, the values of the pixels are averaged up to get a grey scale representation and then a new image is recreated based on the new averages. | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? Scale image allows the images to be resized. Before the pixels are their normal size, but now they are averaged up to be able to compress the images. | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Scaling an image is lossy compression. The quality of the file is reduced but the file size is also compressed. | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;../images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39;

I also used algorithms to manipulate lists in certain ways. It is important to check the values of indices for certain programs. Indices are very important in lists because they have the value of where each data point is located. . Quiz . I scored an 8/10 on the quiz. I got questions 7 and 9 wrong. . Question 7 . Link to Image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v6sMC8NobA_R4UbF3aJBKvRwTDdfT_xb/view?usp=sharing . Question: What is Base 0 Indexing? | Actual Answer: Seguence demarcated with an Index starting from 0 | . I originally answered a) Binary, thinking that this would refer to the 0s and 1s. This was a silly mistake, and I forgot that Binary conversions are done with base 2. When a list has an index of 0 for its first element, this would be Base 0 Indexing, since the first index is at 0. . Question 9 . Link to Image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zmxeXww2YxTBzhzHWRuU_J0pQXQYPBSj/view?usp=sharing . Question: I want to iterate over a list until the user inputs &#39;quit&#39;. What loop would I use? | Actual Answer: FOR loops | . My first answer was while loops because I thought it would make sense for the command to run while a certain condition is true, which would be if the user has not quit. FOR loops would work because it could include for every action, which could include opening an app, lowering the brightness, or shutting down the machine and quitting. . Reflection . I thought I did decently well on the quiz. It will be important to pay attention to what the question is asking for to prevent silly mistakes. I will also need to remember to think through problems, and go through each answer choice to find the best one. . Important Notes . Iteration can repeat something multiple times, either based on a condition or a set count | Lists methods Mutate, meaning they actively change the list, but they don&#39;t return anything.

Question 4 . See image . Question 5 . To select the number 69, you must go through binary search. First, you must find the middle value by adding the first(1) and last index(8) value and dividing by 2. Since that value is a decimal(3.5), round up(4), and the element is 6. | This is not the intended value, so take each half of the list, before the middle and after the middle and repeat binary search. Repeating this process for the first half finds a middle value of that portion(1+4/2 = 2.5, round to index 3, whose element has a value of 3). For the back half of the list, we repeat this value, with the 6-8th elements, selecting index 7, which has a value of 11. | Since the value of 69 is not found, we must repeat the binary search process. Now, the back half only has the endpoints to be checked, indices 6 and 8. Index 6 is 9, which is not the intended value, but index 8 is the intended value of 69. | . Question 6 . See image . Question 7 . An order that can be used for binary search is: . [&quot;Market&quot;, &quot;Ralphs&quot;, &quot;store&quot;, &quot;Target&quot;, &quot;Walmart&quot;] This is because the strings are in alphabetical order, which would make sense. | . Question 8 . Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because binary search allows the computer to check exponentially more numbers each search. A binary search algorithm keeps on multiplying the amount of numbers checked by 2 each time. The sequential search checks each element individually, which will probably take a longer time, since the algorithm must go through every item of a list. . Question 9 . See image . To find the number 36, it would take 2 checks. The middle value on the first check would be 16, the 3rd index((1+5)/2). Then, we take the parts of the list on each side of the middle element. Before 16 are 64 and 36, while after 16 are 11 and 9. For the first part of the list there are 2 indices, 1 and 2. Using the binary search formula, (1+2)/2 = 1.5, which rounds up to the element at index 2, which is 36, the designated value. . def binary_search(list, value): bottom = 0 top = len(list) - 1 mid = 0 while bottom &lt;= top: mid = (bottom + top) // 2 if list[mid] &lt; value: bottom = mid + 1 elif list[mid] &gt; value: top = mid - 1 else: return mid return -1 numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] x = 4 test = binary_search(numbers, x) if test != -1: print(&quot;Element&quot;, str(x), &quot;is present at index&quot;, str(test)) else: print(&quot;Element is not present in array&quot;) .

            "content": "CSA Projects . I was able to see many cool projects from people who had much more experience coding than me. The CSA projects were very refined and combined both frontend and backend expertise to create a successful project. . . This project was meant to help create an inventory for a local car dealership. It was interesting to see how they interacted with real business owners to create a site which fit the needs of the business. . . This site was built to help students study better. It features interactive ways to be able to take notes and also presents useful resources and articles to students. It was interesting to see how fellow Nighthawk coders can work to help create their own solutions to the problems which are prevalent to many high schoolers, like studying tools. . Photography . . Through photography, I was able to see how we can capture interesting and significant moments of everyday lives. For example, one person was able to capture a beautiful picture of downtown at night on a day when a regular person would have seen it as a regular night. Additionally, different techniques can create meaningful photos. The contrast of the blue waves and the dark sky at the beach create a sense of fear and sadness, but also hope in the same photo. . Ceramics . . In Ceramics, I saw projects of people who had made teapots. It was interesting to see the creations of students and things which they could potentially use. Also, each student had their own ways of decorating their teapots. One student used yellow as their main color and then on the plate, they used yellow as a highlight and blue as the main color to create an intricate set. Another student created an almost galatic theme and colorway for their teapot, which showed how interesting it can be when colors are blended. . Reflections . I learned a lot about creativity through Night at the Museum. I saw how students were able to contribute to needs in society by using their skills to create websites which were easy to use. I also saw how photographers were able to capture specific moments in order to make a special picture out of an ordinary moment. I also saw how ceramics could be used to display various art patterns. . I think it would be interesting to make a more visually appealing and interesting site in the future, with more interaction and visibility for the user. This seems to draw more people in and could help them in a way. I could also consider seeing if any local businesses need help with a certain thing in order to contribute to my community. .",

The given procedure randomly selects the players who will be for the user to choose from. . ii . The program uses these players for the game. . iii . The identified features ensures that there are no repeat players and makes the game less buggy for the users. . iv . The algorithm works by first selecting two random players from the database in order to present to the user. Then, they are checked to make sure that they do not match. The code will then check for which player the user clicked on. If it is the one with more of the statistic, then they will get a point and continue the game. Otherwise, the user loses and the score resets to 0. . Part d . i .

First call: If the user will gain points from selecting the player with more | Second call: Seeing if the game will end if a player with less of statistic is selected | . iii .

I answered C, that the loop would end up with the number 10 being displayed. However, I forgot to see that loop causes i to be reset to 1 every time, so it can never reach the value of 4. So the correct answer would be D, where the program loops forever. . Question 23 . I originally selected the answer of D, where the count would displayed after every iteration. I did not take into account that the flowchart showed that count would only be displayed if it was over 5, so the correct answer would be A, 5. . Question 25 . I selected the option that there would be an infinite loop if j=7, or the answer C. However, I missed the fact that j was initially 1, so that 2 would be added on every time to j. This meant that 7 would be a possible value for j, but 6 would not be. So, the correct answer would be j=6, or A. . Question 28 . I got this question wrong because I did not select two options. I was planning to originally select A and C because they both would get the robot to the gray square, but I think I forget to select A. It is important to pay attention to my answers. . Question 32 . I originally selected A for this problem, saying that only program 1 would get the correct answer. However, both programs would get the right answer for the question. I did not realize that the second program segment would add 1 to the program for every 1 in n(1 for 1, 2 for 2, 3 for 3, etc), and then would subtract 1 from n every time. So, this would end up yielding the same result as the other algorithm. This means that C, where both programs work, would be correct. . Question 45 . Heuristic: In coding, getting a solution by trial and error, with loosely defined rules | . I did not know what heuristic meant, so this taught me a new word. After going over the meaning, I realized that this is good when you cannot get the specific solution to a problem, but can get an approximate one. I originally answered that a heuristic approach would be good for a problem when it could be solved in reasonable time and an approximate solution is needed(A). However, you could solve this by just finding the exact solution, and don’t need trial and error. However, if you don’t know how long it will take for a solution to be found, you can use trial and error(a heuristic approach) to get an approximate solution. So, the answer would be C. . Reflection . I felt like a lot of my mistakes where things which I knew, I just had not checked over my work or problem properly. So, I should keep in mind to check over my answers carefully and to read the questions and diagrams carefully in order to ensure my success. .",

Video games and social media can be good ways for us to connect with our friends, have fun, and take a break from life, but it is important to have balance in life. If we let video games and social media control our life, we will not be able to live out the other experiences in life. While these forms of enjoyment can be useful, it is important to remember that there are many facets of life and many things to enjoy. So, it is important to participate in activities outdoors. With many | 5.2 Digital Divide . In a digital world, you can empower yourself by using technology and learning about technology. There are many facets to technology, from hardware to software. There are many avenues to be able to learn, as even if one does not have access to technology, libraries and schools may have computers to use technology and empower people. Additionally, even when people have access to some technology, libraries can give access to more complex technology, like 3-D printers. | To help others who are not empowered with technology, people with technology can do things to empower others. For example, if an empowered individual got a new laptop, they could donate their old laptop to those who do not have as much technology. Something we could do at Del Norte is organize volunteering to help teach students about technology and be able to contribute to efforts which would allow people to have a greater access to technology. | Paper and red tape can block digital empowerment if it used full time. Before COVID, very few of my classes used computers on a daily basis. After COVID, pretty much all of my classes used computers. There are some barriers to digital empowerment if classes constantly use paper or red tape. However, if classes mix both computers and paper lessons and work, it will be beneficial to improving digital empowerment. While it is important to retain and build skills with both paper and the digital world, has they both give students the option to learn in their preferred method, focusing too much on one could be harmful. | Questions From Canvas . I think my project will have some beneficial impacts. Educate people about sports | Help me and my team learn more about coding | Entertain users with interactive site Potential Harms: | If not updated frequently, the website could provide incorrect statistics | . | Pros of Internet Blocker: Ensures that students go on school friendly sites | Helps students pay attention during school by blocking certain sites and social medias Cons of Internet Blockers: | Some sites for research are not able to be used | Some Computer Science sites are not available because they haven’t been verified | Harder for students to be able to study everything at school | . | With the digital divide, it can be harder for people without access to technology to be able to have access to the newest advancements and news on their devices. This would put these people at a disadvantage when trying to get into jobs or schools. Additionally, with lots of of complex technology, it could be very hard to be able to know everything. So, we would spend more and more time on our computers, which can be bad for our health and cause people to get more and more distracted. | 5.3 Computing Bias . Different programs have different purposes, so there are different algorithms to do different things. It can be harmful for apps to have a certain audience because they want to focus on having as much attention as possible, so they can end up being addictive. | Virtual assistants may have inherent bias because we usually view that women’s voices are more comforting to a person. | Algorithms from TikTok can be meant to keep the user on the app for as long as possible. | I think the HP bias was unintentional. The owner of the computer may have thought of it as intentional. However, there were probably biases within the testing algorithm because they may not have sampled as many black or dark-skinned people. This is harmful not only for the user, but also for the company, since they will be marked racist. It is important to be able to have a diversity on user testing because it will be necessary for companies to be accommodating of a variety of users, which will benefit both the consumer and the company. | . 5.4 Crowdsourcing . In CSP, with a wide variety of students in the class, we are lucky to be able to have lots of different viewpoints. This will help us develop code which is more accommodating of all people. A crowdsourcing idea which I have for CSP is creating an open source code repository for people to edit. This can be a copy of my own repository, and with the advice of many students, I will be able to see different ways to make my code more efficient. I could initiate this by advertising this during class or on Slack in order to be able to communicate with other students to inform them of the open source code. | A crowdsourcing idea which I have is by having a form to be able take in consumer input on my Create Performance Task site. This would be able to be requested by anyone on Del Norte and they would answer questions about how they like my program and what could be done to improve it. I would do this because I would be able to get a lot of information about how to better meet the needs of the consumer. This will allow me to see viewpoints I did not see and have an overall better functioning program. | At Night at the Museum, it would probably be best to supply a form which will allow people to provide their input on my program. I will have a form link at the end of my higher or lower game in order to get user input. I would probably asked for the rating of the game and also add comments or features which they believe they could improve the program. I could create a graph representing the rating of my program and also make outlines and potentially change my code to incorporate the user input into my program. | . 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns . Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal: Waives copyright interest Allows to be accessed on public domain | . | Open Source MIT License: The usage of code is not restricted Allows closed source projects to be distributed | Authors will be able to get credit. However, this could just mean a simple name mention | Allows for GitHub repository to be private | . | GPL License: Almost any freedom with project, except distributing closed source versions The GitHub repository must be public | . | Licenses are guidelines for distribution and usage of code They help to give the author credit and help to keep things confidential | Are important for businesses and people to be able to get their money | They can be bad when ignored | . | Copyright ensures that people can own the work they produce Can be good when people try to claim they own someone else’s work | Can be bad when the owner constantly restricts usage of their work, even if it is not the main focus(ex. taking profit from creator using their work as background music) | . | Sites which “pirate” copyrighted things can be good and bad Technically illegal under licensing rules, but give greater access to items which can educate people | Does not give creators credit | Can be on sketchy sites which perpetrate scams | . | Personal Fastpages: GPL License People can see the project freely | . | Frontend/Backend of CPT Project: Open Source MIT License People can use our project as an inspiration for projects they take upon | We would like to be cited for our work | Allows more freedom with what people want to do with our things | . | . 5.6 Safe Computing . I have seen lots of PII used in GitHub projects. I have seen examples of people using names, phone numbers, emails, and usernames for projects. | I think PII is important for being able to see information about a specific person. Everyone has their own information which makes them unique, like their awards and special hobbies and these can be shared online on a place like LinkedIn to further careers. Things like phone numbers and addresses are also available, but if they are in the wrong hands, they can be detrimental to people. Things like SSNs and bank numbers should not be in the hands of other people because they are very important to our lives. | Good passwords are ones which are long and have a variety of symbols, numbers, and letters(upper and lowercase). Bad passwords are simple and reused. To authenticate passwords, websites can have checks on passwords to meet certain length and complexity requirements. Additionally, users may be able to download a program which tells them if one of their passwords is too similar to another one. | Symmetric Encryption: When a single key is used to encrypt and decrypt data | Asymmetric encryption: When one key is used to encrypt data and another one is used to decrypt the data | One example of how we use encryption through AWS is how our repositories use SSH keys. These allow us to encrypt data for our repositiories. | Phishing schemes which I have learned about the hard way are ones where they slightly change the link of a website to look like they are the regular website, but are actually not. Other potential ways of phishing could be emails where someone impersonates a company or person or phone calls. It is important to pay attention to the details to determine if a call, email, or website is a scam. | .",

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template.

This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Hack 1 . A decidable problem is one which an algorithm will be able to solve no matter the input. An undecidable problem is one where it is not possible for any algorithm to come to a correct solution. Sometimes, an undecidable problem can have some parts solved by an algorithm, but for a problem to be decidable, it must have all parts solved by an algorithm. . Hack 2 . Answer: C. (3x8)^2 | This is correct because it is features 2 integers being multiplied together and then raised to the power of 2. | . Hack 3 . Explanation for Code: Defines a function to find a peak, and goes through each item, and checks if it is greater than the stored value. . | Why this is more efficient: This uses much less code and will work for all lists. This code is easy to write an understand. . NOTE: A binary search would be much more time efficient, as it would use exponential time. However, I was having trouble creating this code due to the overall challenge and expertise needed for creating such a complex algorithm. | . | . function peak_finder(array) { var peak = array[0]; for (i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i ++) { if (array[i] &gt; peak) { var peak = array[i]; } } return peak; } var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]; console.log(peak_finder(numbers)); . 8 . Hack 4 . Explanation for Code: This code defines a list, which has the numbers. Then, it redefines the list of numbers, using the function in Python called sorted. This automatically sorts the data in order from lowest to highest. . | Why this is more efficient: This is a much smaller piece of code, making it much easier to write and understand. It calls the data less and does not create any new variables other than data. It uses a built in function to sort the data, instead of recreating a function to do so. . | . data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] data = sorted(data) print(data) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Hack 5 . Explanation for Code: Imports the permutation method from the library itertools. Using this, we can use a built in command to create permutations. Using a for loop, we can iterate through all possible permutations, and print them. . | Why this is more efficient: This is not only a much smaller piece of code, but it does not require recalling a variable multiple times, like in the former program.

Using libraries will allow coding to be much easier, and use work that has already been developed. Documentation makes it easy for someone to read my code, and many programs have a documentation which outlines usage for the users. The random library is used very frequently in Python programming. Randomization can be very useful in programs. A lot of programs which we see use randomization, such as games or websites. . Notes . Software libraries contain procedures used in creating novel programs | Libraries and prewritten code can make writing algorithms much easier | Libraries simplify complex programs | APIs(application program interfaces) specify how procedures in libraries should behave and be utilized | Reading documentation makes it much easier to understand how to use libraries/APIs | Useful random functions include: random.randint(a, b): generates a random number.

Short Answer Questions . Using libraries allows users to access and reuse pre-written code. This allows algorithms to be made more efficient. Additionally, there are many libraries which are created for multiple different purposes, which makes it easier for programmers to create more complex algorithms. | First, the code segment imports the random library for use. Then, the program takes in names from user input, and puts them into a list(names). Then, the variable num_items finds the length of the list of names. The random_choice variable generates a random number which will be an index of the list. random_choice makes use of the random.randint function and generates a value from 0 to the maximum index(length of list minus 1). Then the program finds the person who is associated with the randomly generated value. Finally, the program prints that individual&#39;s name. | import random # takes user input, puts it into a list of names names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, seperated by a comma.&quot;) names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) num_items = len(names) # uses random to choose a random number random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) # associates random number with a name person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] # prints name print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) . Dwayne Johnson is going to buy the meal today! . Coding Challenge . Question 1 . import random names_list = [&quot;McCorkle&quot;, &quot;Patrick&quot;, &quot;Josh&quot;, &quot;Justin&quot;, &quot;Kyler&quot;, &quot;Jared&quot;, &quot;Derek&quot;, &quot;Jalen&quot;, &quot;Daniel&quot;, &quot;Taylor&quot;, &quot;Dak&quot;, &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Andy&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;Davis&quot;] random_list = [] def addPeople(list, new_list): count = 1 while count &lt;= 5: number = random.randint(0, len(list) - 1) new_list.append(list[number]) count += 1 return new_list print(addPeople(names_list, random_list)) . [&#39;Josh&#39;, &#39;Jared&#39;, &#39;McCorkle&#39;, &#39;Jalen&#39;, &#39;Dak&#39;] . Documentation . This program generates 5 random names from a list. A list of names is predefined, as well as another empty list for the names to be put into. The function addPeople is defined for the sequence of code. It establishes a counter variable, which allows for 5 names to be appended to using a while loop, as the program runs while the counter variable is under a certain value. A random number is generated using the random.randint function, which generates a random integer from 0 to 1 less than the length of the list. This makes sure that when it calls the index to append into the new list, the index values fall in the range of the list of full names. Finally, the program returns the new list. . Question 2 . import random score1 = 0 score2 = 0 def DiceGame(): score1 = random.randint(1, 6) + random.randint(1, 6) score2 = random.randint(1, 6) + random.randint(1, 6) if score1 &gt; score2: print(&quot;Player 1 won with a score of &quot; + str(score1) + &quot; points!&quot;) if score1 &lt; score2: print(&quot;Player 2 won with a score of &quot; + str(score2) + &quot; points!&quot;) if score1 == score2: print(&quot;Both players tied with &quot; + str(score1) + &quot; points!&quot;) DiceGame() DiceGame() . Player 1 won with a score of 8 points! Both players tied with 9 points! . Documentation . The function must import the random library in order to replicate rolling a pair of dice. 2 variables are defined at first. Then, a function is created to represent the dice game. To give each player a score, the random.randint function is called twice, adding both random numbers to each other and storing that value. The random.randint function runs from 1 to 6, which represents a dice rolling a number from 1 to 6 equally. This is repeated for both players. Then, the scores are compared. If both scores are equal, a message is printed stating there is a tie. If one player has more points than the other, a statement saying that player with more points won is printed. . Extra .

This lesson provided great insight into how to create procedures and make robots. Procedures are important in many coding languages, and having efficient names for them will be key, especially when there is a long program. Procedures also have arguments which allow different arguments to be called. Moving robots can be challenging, as it can be hard to visualize and describe the specific rotations it would take. The nature of direction makes it much easier for us to do, but very hard for us to describe and instruct upon. I had some challenges with the robot moving problems, but with lots of practice, I can achieve mastery. .",

Question: What is Base 0 Indexing? | Actual Answer: Seguence demarcated with an Index starting from 0 | . I originally answered a) Binary, thinking that this would refer to the 0s and 1s. This was a silly mistake, and I forgot that Binary conversions are done with base 2.

My first answer was while loops because I thought it would make sense for the command to run while a certain condition is true, which would be if the user has not quit. FOR loops would work because it could include for every action, which could include opening an app, lowering the brightness, or shutting down the machine and quitting. . Reflection .

Blog . 3.1 Focused on variables and assigning values to those variables. Variables will hold value throughout the program. When naming a variable, it is important to make it simple and not too long, for ease of use and calling in a program. We can store different types of values in the variable, like an integer, string, boolean, or float. When calling variable, the value stored in the variable will be the same as the most recent definition of the variable above the call. I think it is important to practice questions with lots of reassignment because theses questions can become very confusing quickly if you do not pay attention while going through the pseudocode. . 3.2 Hacks .

Skill 3.A - Generalize data sources through variables. Skill 3.C - Explain how abstraction manages complexity. Skill 4.A - Explain how a code segment or program functions. Skill 4.C - Identify and correct errors in algorithms and programs, including error discovery through testing. . Question 8 . My Answer: A Correct Answer: B . I thought that the index started at 0, and forgot that the code would not work if j or k were values greater than the length of numList. . Question 11 . My Answer: D Correct Answer: B . I did not pay enough attention to the question, and did not notice that the if statement iterates until k is greater than myList. This means that the function will check through all elements. . Question 14 . My Answer: A Correct Answer: B . If 7 is run through command, “check” will be displayed. However, 6 also displays “check”, which is incorrect. . Question 30 . My Answer: A Correct Answer: B . Using a list makes it easier to apply the same procedure to all the items in the list. . Question 39 . My Answer: A Correct Answer: B . Silly mistake, thought question was asking for potential item. . . Reflection . After taking this test, I now know have a better idea of what to focus on when taking multiple choice tests. I should pay a greater amount of attention when answering questions, and always be sure to read the question carefully. Doing this will be able to cut down on some mistakes. I also have to remember the exam will be in psuedo-code, so there may be terms which I need to familiarize myself with.

They featured lots of donuts, but each student had their own distinct donut and background. It was really interesting. . . Art . Art is definitely something I struggle with, but I saw really cool art pieces at Night at the Museum. There were many different styles of art, and they all looked really good. . .

We are able to get the question, and 4 answer choices from the json file. We still need to work on a way for the user to see if they are correct or not . . We stil have to finish up some designing. Once we do that, we also have to design each individual quiz page so that one question pops up at a time and answer choices can be selected. We might also include a scoring page, where we keep track of how many questions the user got right/wrong. . We plan to finish this by our design by splitting up the work while also keeping track of everyone else’s work and posting any problems/issues. Backend developers - Tay and Luke - will work on coding for scores and also make/use API to get the questions into the Frontend | Frontend developers - Adi and I - will implement the API and use it to get questions into the quiz pages.

The program will take the user’s notes and, based on it, select the key terms and output multiple quiz questions which will be displayed randomly. It will score the quiz and tell you what you got wrong and what you need to study on. | . Data Abstraction . The program will contain lists and dictionaries. Every key term will have a definition and these will be stored in a dictionary which will be stored in a list.

The dictionaries and databases will manage the complexity of the program by organizing the data inputted by the user. It will also help calling back to create the quiz. | . Procedural Abstraction . A function will be created to call back to the data inputted by the user. The function will iterate over the dictionary/database and use the values in them as a parameter to make a quiz. | .

Testing . The function will be called each time the user inputs a note and each time the user generates a quiz. When the user inputs a note, the function is called and saves the note inside a dictionary or database. When the user presses the button that generates the quiz, the function is again called and iterates through the user’s notes to generate a quiz that is related to the key terms the user inputted. | .

Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. . In the Nighthawk Coders APCSP you can find an Overview and Examples using APIs:APCSP APIs menu- Using Covid RapidAPI JavaScript frontend API code in APCSP Fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-rapidapi.md | . | Making a Jokes API (this will next API tech talk) Frontend.

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",

FYI, related tests could be in same Issue by using markdown checkboxes to separate tests. | . | . Hacks . Some errors which may arise in our project could be how we would store user inputs for a certain user. Storing this could be a challenge, so we would probably need to test that out. | Some test cases could be testing user input and how the user would be displayed. We could test user storage by listing out a list of users. We could also test storing of questions and answers. We could do this by having a page which shows the list of questions and answers a user has. | We can document bugs on the scrumboard and how we solved the problem. | Single tests will be very useful for testing small features. We can use this as we add pieces of the program together, and then get a large, successful project. | Things we can use single tests for: storing user input, repeating code segments which loop, and deploying the site. | .

PBL - Project Based Learning is an inquiry-based instructional approach, in a real-world context, where students generate the pathways and products that meet defined, standards-based outcomes | Project - Time frame in which your culminating product is developed through workshops and deliverables | Culminating Project - Compilation of deliverables derived from the Deconstructed TEKS that come together to create a final presentation/demonstration of what was learned throughout the project | Driving Questions - Helps to initiate and focus the inquiry. It also captures and communicates the purpose of the project in a succinct question. It creates interest and a feeling of challenge. It guides the project work. It helps student answer the question: “Why are we doing this?” | Enduring Understanding - Refers to the important ideas or CORE processes that are central to a discipline and transferable to new situations and that have lasting value BEYOND the classroom… Learning should be measured in YEARS. “30 hours vs. 30 days vs. 30 years” | Entry Launch - The engaging activity that kickstarts your PBL. | Entry Document - The document used to drive the project, connect the TEKS to the idea, and develop the KNOW/K2K. Can be delivered in multiple formats. | Checkpoints - Scheduled mini-presentations held throughout the project to allow for formative assessment, positive &amp; negative feedback, whole group collaboration, accountability, speaking practice, and progression toward project completion. These develop 21st Century Skills and reinforce the focus on the enduring understanding, driving question, and culminating product. | Facilitating Questions - Appropriate way that teachers use to guide students toward the enduring understanding/deliverable/goal, redirect students, “pull out” content vocabulary, or help students make connections (conceptual, cross-discipline, relevance, value). Open ended is most effective, but close ended, probing techniques are acceptable for scaffolding. | Workshops - Planned lessons that are listed for students in a checklist or added assessments indicate. Commonly held in small groups to meet the need of the student(s) or group(s). | Deliverable - “End result” or goal of a workshop that will directly be used for the realization of the culminating product. It can be knowledge, but it is typically something that will be presented, built upon, or used to achieve the project’s desired result. | .",

Sleep by 11:00 everyday | Practice my instrument for at least 30 minutes each day | Work on college applications for at least 30 minutes each day | Minimize homework on the weekend(less specific) | . Goals can help us feel more organized, even we have a lot on our plate. This will help reduce stress levels in us. Especially with college application season, I think creating a list of small and specific goals related to applications will allow me to be less stressed, feel more in control, and be happier. .",

We will create an introduction page, and have a 3 quesiton quiz. The intro page will have a button which allows the user to go to the next question, as well as an image related to the quiz. . We plan to have our quiz be about Del Norte High School, so it could provide some uses to Del Norte students. Potential topics for quiz questions could be: . What is our mascot? | What classes are offered at DNHS? | Who is our principal? | What time does school start? | What time does school end? | When are late start days? | . Each question will have 4 answer choices, with an image or button corresponding to answer choices. If the user clicks on the button corresponding to the right answer, they will be taken to a “correct screen.” If the user gets the question wrong(clicks on an incorrect answer choice), they will be taken to an “incorrect page.” . On each “correct screen”, we plan to have an image which showcases an image of validation, and a button for the next question. On each “incorrect page”, we would have the opposite of the “correct screen”, but still a button for the next question. . After the user answers all the questions, we will take them to a final screen, which could show their score or take them to the beginning of the quiz if they want to retake it. . Plan of Screens: Home Screen -&gt; Question 1 Screen -&gt; Correct/Wrong Screen -&gt; Question 2 Screen -&gt; Correct/Wrong Screen -&gt; Question 3 Screen -&gt; Correct/Wrong Screen -&gt; Final Screen . Our Code . We utilized a lot of onEvent statements in our code, as they would let us know if a specific button has been clicked. . . Additionally, to get a score, we defined a variable and added to it every time the user selected a correct answer. . We created a variable results box, which is varied due to the display of the score. We did this since each user would have a different score. . . The playSound button adds a fun little twist, as it plays custom audio to the user after completion of the quiz. . We often looked at the code in the text form to help us build familiarity with Javascript. The debug console also helped us a lot in figuring out our mistakes, and we will use it a lot in future projects. We wonder if the debug console can be used in other languages, like Python. . The Quiz. . Here is the link to our quiz. . Our Experience . Successes, Discoveries, and Challenges . We created a quiz which was able to track the score of the user. We had some challenges defining a variable to store the score, since the syntax is different from python. We realized that we had to define the variable, and then add to it using different syntax. This is different from python because python allows the coder to keep on redefining a variable. . We also had some trouble with formatting, and centering the images and items on the screen. We learned about the pixel dimensions of the screen(it is 320 x 450 px!) We then had to use dimensions of other items on the screen to help us center the images. It was also interesting to see how the positioning system works. . What We Learned . Using AppLab was a very cool experience. It really helped us learn more about Javascript, with an easy to use interface. We liked using the blocks, but the ability to check out the code in true Javascript helped us see basic Javascript programming. This project helped us learn about user interaction and how Javascript is a powerful language for that. . We also got a preview of how to use images in Javascript. We saw the positioning system, but there still a lot to learn about how to call the shapes in real code. . Extra Project . We decided to test out other features in App Lab. We did this by creating a simple game of tic tac toe. We learned about defining variables, altering images, and even adding sound! The program allows two users to play a game of tic tac toe, and allows the user the option to reset the scoreboard without restarting the app. We also continued practicing Javascript, and using the debug console as a way to help us see where our code was going wrong.

The boxes which are around the articles seem to not have been there(with minima), and I don’t know if that was supposed to happen when changing the theme to Merlot. The preview images were very large, instead of the small ones which minima has. Also, the GitHub user button did not seem to work. It can be seen that minima is the optimized theme for Fastpages. . Customizing the Fastpage Site . I experimented with dark mode on the site, as well as changing the color of dark mode from black to a different color. It is a neat way to customize the site, but I think I will stick with the regular dark mode for now. . . Time Box Fragments . I have created a time box on the frontpage describing what I have done for the week, and linked the review ticket. . Naming and Tagging . Naming and tagging are very useful on the blog to organize material. Using the tagging feature, I have been able to organize my posts and notebooks based on the language, the subject they are for, and they week they were posted. . . Using the Searchbar . The search bar is also a powerful tool for this blog. It helps to find posts with keywords, but it also finds posts with certain tags. In the image, I was easily able to search for posts with the “week0” tag. . . Changing _config.yml . I had originally changed the config file to show the preview images, which the site did not do before. I changed show_image: to true and this allows for a different, more interesting format. . Using Liquid . I learned that liquid could make creating the time box easier. Liquid has the capability of “incrememnting” variables, or adding one each time the variable is called.

[{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;John&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Mortensen&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;October 21&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;jmortensen@powayusd.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;2015-Fusion&#39;, &#39;2011-Ranger&#39;, &#39;2003-Excursion&#39;, &#39;1997-F350&#39;, &#39;1969-Cadillac&#39;]}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Sunny&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Naidu&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;August 2&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;Temecula&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;snaidu@powayusd.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: [&#39;4Runner&#39;]}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Arnav&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Kanekar&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;July 3&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;**********@*****.***&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: &#39;None&#39;}, {&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;John&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Cena&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;April 23&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;Tampa&#39;, &#39;Email&#39;: &#39;johncena@gmail.com&#39;, &#39;Owns_Cars&#39;: &#39;2006 Ford GT, 1970 Plymouth Superbird&#39;}] . For Loops . Using a for loop to iterate through a list. . sports = [&quot;football&quot;, &quot;track&quot;, &quot;soccer&quot;, &quot;basketball&quot;, &quot;tennis&quot;] # list # iterates based on the range, so in this case it will only iterate 5 times for i in range(5): print(sports[i]) # would not print more than 5 sports, even if list is longer . football track soccer basketball tennis . For Loop with an Index . Creating a list and using a for loop with indexes to print it. This iterates for every index in the list, making it more powerful and easier to code with. . cake_flavors = [&quot;chocolate&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;vanilla&quot;] # List # For loop, for index in list for i in cake_flavors: print(i) # Print the flavor . chocolate strawberry vanilla . Using the While Loop and Inputs . This demonstrates usage of the while loop. The while loop calls a function as long as a certain condition is met. This is also another example of creating dictionaries using inputs. . meals = {} # empty dictionary length = 4 # runs as long as there are less than 4 items in the dictionary while len(meals) &lt; length: name = input(&quot;Name a food.&quot;) rating = input(&quot;How would you rate the meal on a scale of 1 - 10?&quot;) meals[name] = rating # determines the key and the value print(meals) . {&#39;pineapple pizza&#39;: &#39;5&#39;, &#39;chicken alfredo&#39;: &#39;8&#39;, &#39;fried chicken&#39;: &#39;10&#39;, &#39;mango&#39;: &#39;9&#39;} . Recursion . Recursive functions are helpful, but can be inefficient since it keeps on recalling the function. . def factorial(i): # defining the function if i == 0: # will not recall function return 1 if i == 1: # will not recall function return i if i != 1: return i * factorial(i - 1) # recalls the function, but at lesser value print(factorial(5)) print(factorial(0)) print(factorial(1)) . 120 1 1 . Tools . Using other capabilities to organize lists. These are very useful tools. . Reverse Order . Command to output a list in reverse order. . countdown = [3, 2, 1] # New list print(countdown) countdown.reverse() # Reversing the list print(countdown) . [3, 2, 1] [1, 2, 3] . This shows that the .reverse() statement is used to reverse a list. . Sort and Set . More functions that can help to alphabetize lists as well as make sure there are no duplicates in the list. . cake_flavors = [&quot;chocolate&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;vanilla&quot;] # Appending multiple items cake_flavors.append(&quot;red velvet&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;lemon&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;marble&quot;) print(cake_flavors) # Printing the new list # Sort function cake_flavors.sort() print(cake_flavors) # Alphabetized list # Appending more flavors cake_flavors.append(&quot;lemon&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;german chocolate&quot;) cake_flavors.append(&quot;carrot&quot;) print(cake_flavors) cake_flavors = set(cake_flavors) print(cake_flavors) . [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;, &#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;] [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;, &#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;] [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;, &#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;german chocolate&#39;, &#39;carrot&#39;] {&#39;red velvet&#39;, &#39;carrot&#39;, &#39;marble&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;, &#39;german chocolate&#39;, &#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;lemon&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;} . Showcases the .append(), .sort(), and set(). Append adds a new item to the list, sort puts the list in alphabetical order, and set removes any duplicatte items. . Quiz . Creating a quiz like last week, except using a list of dictionaries. This makes it easier to store questions and answers as key and value pairs. . quiz = [] # empty list #variables question_count = 5 score = 0 # appending some questions quiz.append({ &quot;What type of language is Python&quot; : &quot;object oriented&quot;, &quot;How do you get an output in Python?&quot; : &quot;print&quot; }) quiz.append({ &quot;Is a dictionary a primitive or a collection?&quot; : &quot;collection&quot;, &quot;How do you add more information to a list?&quot; : &quot;append&quot;, &quot;What do you need to call to get the value in a dictionary?&quot; : &quot;key&quot; }) # function to print questions and get answers def questioning(ask): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + ask) global ans ans = input() print(&quot;Answer: &quot; + ans) # for loop to iterate through the dictionary for dict in quiz: for question, answer in dict.items(): # for the key and value pair questioning(question) # calling function if ans.lower() == answer: score += 1 print(&quot;Your answer is correct.&quot;) else: print(&quot;You are incorrect.&quot;) # percentage calculator from last time def grade(sco, quests): percent = 100 * float(sco)/float(quests) return percent quiz_percentage = grade(score, question_count) # Defining variable print(&quot;You got &quot; + str(score) + &quot; of &quot; + str(question_count) + &quot; questions correct.&quot;) print(&quot;Your score is &quot; + str(quiz_percentage) + &quot;%.&quot;) . Question: What type of language is Python Answer: OBJECT ORiented Your answer is correct. Question: How do you get an output in Python? Answer: pRINT Your answer is correct. Question: Is a dictionary a primitive or a collection? Answer: primitive You are incorrect. Question: How do you add more information to a list? Answer: APPEnd Your answer is correct. Question: What do you need to call to get the value in a dictionary? Answer: kEY Your answer is correct. You got 4 of 5 questions correct. Your score is 80.0%. .",

Finding the secrets of .git! . Learning about bash was really interesting to see the many things it can show the user. It looks like it can be a very helpful tool. . Hacks . Is there anything we use to verify tools we install? Think about versions. . Using the bash script, we can use --version option for each of the tools to verify which version of the tool is installed. For example, executing the command python --version in bash will give us the version of python the user has installed. This helps to verify the tool that has been set up, and tells the version, so the user can know if they want to update it. Also, we can use conda list to check the programs and their versions. . Is there anything we could verify with Anaconda? . Using conda list, we can verify the programs installed. This is also useful to see what version of the program is installed. . How would you update a repository? . To update a remote repository with changes made to the local repository, we can use git push to push changes from a local repository to the remote repository. To update a local repository with changes made to the remote repository, we use git pull to pull the changes from the remote repository to the local repository. Additionally, git add and git commit are used to stage and commit changes. . Really cool would be automating a procedure from installation. . This can be done by writing and running programs using the Shell Script. .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
