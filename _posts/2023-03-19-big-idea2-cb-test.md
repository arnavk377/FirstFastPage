# Scoring

I was able to do pretty well on this quiz, scoring a 23/25. This is definitely a pretty good score, but I could have scored even more points if I had cut down on my silly mistakes.

## Question 1

This question asked about binary and it is important to remember how bits are used to represent binary numbers. Here, I did my math incorrectly and thought 7 bits were needed to represent a number in the hundreds. I did my calculations incorrectly and I should have realized that 2 to the 6th power is 128.

## Question 2

This question asked about lossless and lossy image compression. These are two things which we have been going over in class with the tech talks, so I did feel experienced with the questions. I felt pretty comfortable with other questions on this quiz asking about lossy and lossless compression. Here, I did not read the question properly. Lossless compression only allows for it to be made sure that data can be reconstructed, it does not do anything with the security purposes.

# Reflection

I felt a lot better on this quiz, but there were also some questions which I had seen before. I can continue to cut down on errors by getting into the zone of test taking and making sure to read the questions carefully and make sure that I check my answers to the questions.
