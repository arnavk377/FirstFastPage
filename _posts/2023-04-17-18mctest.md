# Scoring

I scored a 63/66 on this practice examination. That is a pretty good score. I could probably cut down on a few mistakes in order to ensure a higher score for the next practice test.

# Corrections

## Question 14
- Incorrect Answer: D. Program A and program B display a different number of values.
- <mark>Correct Answer: C. Program A and program B display the same number of values, but the values differ.</mark>
I chose the incorrect answer because I thought that there would be a difference in values which are the output because they have the i = i+1 step at different points in the algorithm. However, I was incorrect because it takes the same number of iterations to stop each algorithm, since the check for the value for i happens after the i = i+1 and display code are run, depending on the order for the algorithm. So, since there are the same number of iterations, the number of values displayed will be the same. However, the values will be different.

## Question 21
- Incorrect Answer: A. MoveXTimes: 2, RightXTimes: 1, MoveXTimes: 3
- <mark>Correct Answer: B. MoveXTimes: 2, RightXTimes: 3, MoveXTimes: 3</mark>
I was incorrect because I did not realize that the robot had to move left instead of right. So, the RightXTimes function would need to be called in order for the robot to be facing left.

## Question 37
- Incorrect Answer: B. Code segment II displays the correct average, but code segment I does not.
- <mark>Correct Answer: C. Both code segments display the correct average, but code segment I requires more arithmetic operations than code segment II.</mark>
I was incorrect because I did not pay attention to the problem and did not realize that two code segments actually displayed the same value. I did not realize that the average which was computed in every iteration of code segment I would actually get the correct average after all of the values had been summed up and then divided by the length of the list. So, the average step is unnecessary each iteration but will provide the correct answer.

# Reflection

I think I did better on this MC test and feel a bit better about my progress and learning. I felt pretty confident about the topics and could remember things from the Tech Talks we did in class. In every MC practice, it has been evident that I have a few silly mistakes, so if I can cut down on those, I will get even better scores.
