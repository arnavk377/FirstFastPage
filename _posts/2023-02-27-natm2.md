# CSA Projects

I was able to see many cool projects from people who had much more experience coding than me. The CSA projects were very refined and combined both frontend and backend expertise to create a successful project.

This project was meant to help create an inventory for a local car dealership. It was interesting to see how they interacted with real business owners to create a site which fit the needs of the business.

This site was built to help students study better. It features interactive ways to be able to take notes and also presents useful resources and articles to students. It was interesting to see how fellow Nighthawk coders can work to help create their own solutions to the problems which are prevalent to many high schoolers, like studying tools.

# Photography

Through photography, I was able to see how we can capture interesting and significant moments of everyday lives. For example, one person was able to capture a beautiful picture of downtown at night on a day when a regular person would have seen it as a regular night. Additionally, different techniques can create meaningful photos. The contrast of the blue waves and the dark sky at the beach create a sense of fear and sadness, but also hope in the same photo.

# Ceramics

In Ceramics, I saw projects of people who had made teapots. It was interesting to see the creations of students and things which they could potentially use. Also, each student had their own ways of decorating their teapots. One student used yellow as their main color and then on the plate, they used yellow as a highlight and blue as the main color to create an intricate set. Another student created an almost galatic theme and colorway for their teapot, which showed how interesting it can be when colors are blended.

# Reflections

I learned a lot about creativity through Night at the Museum. I saw how students were able to contribute to needs in society by using their skills to create websites which were easy to use. I also saw how photographers were able to capture specific moments in order to make a special picture out of an ordinary moment. I also saw how ceramics could be used to display various art patterns.

I think it would be interesting to make a more visually appealing and interesting site in the future, with more interaction and visibility for the user. This seems to draw more people in and could help them in a way. I could also consider seeing if any local businesses need help with a certain thing in order to contribute to my community.
