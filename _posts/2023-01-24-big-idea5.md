# 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects
1. Beneficial Effects:<br>
- The internet and computing allows us to be able to have access to almost any piece of information we want
- We are able to collaborate and talk with others who we not be able(worldwide) to thanks to the internet
- We are able to do a lot more important tasks online, such as filing for important government appointments, accessing bank funds, and applying to colleges, instead of having to wait in longer lines
Harmful Effects:<br>
- A lot of sources may be wanting to get viewership, so they may stretch the truth or include more opinionated information to appeal to one side in order to retain audience
- People can be more mean on the internet because they are not face to face with the person, so they may act different from how they would act in person
- While we can do more important tasks online, the abundance of important information makes it possible for hackers to steal and take away important information from people
2. I think dopamine issues are real. Video games and social media can be good ways for us to connect with our friends, have fun, and take a break from life, but it is important to have balance in life.

There are many avenues to be able to learn, as even if one does not have access to technology, libraries and schools may have computers to use technology and empower people. Additionally, even when people have access to some technology, libraries can give access to more complex technology, like 3-D printers.
2. To help others who are not empowered with technology, people with technology can do things to empower others. For example, if an empowered individual got a new laptop, they could donate their old laptop to those who do not have as much technology. Something we could do at Del Norte is organize volunteering to help teach students about technology and be able to contribute to efforts which would allow people to have a greater access to technology.
3. Paper and red tape can block digital empowerment if it used full time. Before COVID, very few of my classes used computers on a daily basis. After COVID, pretty much all of my classes used computers. There are some barriers to digital empowerment if classes constantly use paper or red tape. However, if classes mix both computers and paper lessons and work, it will be beneficial to improving digital empowerment. While it is important to retain and build skills with both paper and the digital world, has they both give students the option to learn in their preferred method, focusing too much on one could be harmful.
