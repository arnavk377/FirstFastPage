NASA released some pretty neat images taken with the James Webb Space Telescope.

Using the table function in markdown, we are able to directly compare the images side by side. Comparing the images, we can see that they are both spectacular images, but the image from the **James Webb telescope** is much more *defined*, with a higher image quality.
