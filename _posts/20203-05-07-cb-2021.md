# Scoring

I scored a 61/70 on this practice examination. That is a pretty good score. I should do my best to clean up mistakes for the next test.

## Mistakes

### Q9

I did not know that audio signals are represented by things taken at small intervals and then stored as bits. That is good to know for the test.

### Q14

A: Lines 8 and 12 should be changed
This is correct because it meets the things which the instructions specify for the program. This would give the correct answer.

### Q18

A: If devices B and F fail, then device A will not be able to communicate with device G.
I did not do a good enough job of checking whether these connections would work for this problem. It is important to pay attention to that.

I made a mistake in analyzing which way the robot would go from the original procedure and this messed up my thought process.

The Internet is designed to scale to support an increasing number of users. That is the correct answer.

### Q25

A: The procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.
I did a miscalculation in what the procedure will return because of not paying attention.


### Q46

A: 1, 2, and 3
The order does not matter, so you can select it for anything which does it in the desired order.

### Q49

A: There exist some problems that cannot be solved algorithmically using any computer.
This is correct because there are some unsolvable problems.

### Q68
A: A and C
These answers have duplicates in different spots which would not be removed by the procedure.
