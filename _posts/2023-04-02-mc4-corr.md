# Scoring
I received a 44/50. I was very close to the 90% mark, and I think I need to focus a little more in order to be able to reach that threshold.

# Corrections

## Q3
- My Answer: D 4 --> I tried to isolate computer E from any communications
- Correct: C 3 --> The answer was to isolate computer F to prevent it from communicating with E, which would have broken less connections.

## Q6
- My Answer: B(Each packet contains an encrypted version of the data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing the key needed to decrypt the data.) --> I had the wrong definition of how packets are assembled. The metadata would not have the key to decrypt the data
- Correct: A(Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data.) --> The packet has to have the data transmitted, and the metadata is important to describe the data

## Q9
- My Answer: B(The file is broken into packets for transmission. The userâ€™s browser must request each packet in order until all packets are received.) --> I did not realize that when a file is broken down to transmit, it does not need to have its packets received in order.
- Correct: A(The file is broken into packets for transmission. The packets must be reassembled upon receipt.) --> The packets are broken down and received and then rebuilt to get the file.

## Q41
- My Answer: A(A procedure containsNegatives, which returns true if any negative values appear in the column and returns false otherwise.) --> I did not realize that this would work for the entire column and not check each row individually.
- Correct: C(A procedure findNegative, which returns the row number of the first negative value that appears in the column or -1 if there are no negative values.) --> This procedure checks each row for a negative value, which was asked for by the requirements.

## Q43
- My Answer: D(Reducing the amount of duplicated code) --> Procedural Abstraction would help to be able to generalize the code and have procedures to run the same tasks.
- Correct: B(Making the code run faster) --> The procedural abstraction would probably make the code easier to read, but this does not mean the code would run faster. So, this is not a benefit of procedural abstraction.

## Q49
- My Answer: B --> I did not realize that this code would compare the first value of the code, which will be the maximum value, to the scores, so it would incorrectly return true.
- Correct: A --> This code will not compare the first value, so it will check each student earned score and then determine if they got the maximum points possible.

# Reflection
Obviously, I wish I could have done better on this quiz in order to achieve a higher score. I could have cut down on silly mistakes by reading through the problems carefully. I did not feel the best about data encryption and transmission, so I should definitely look at those topics before the AP exam in order to ensure the highest possible score.
