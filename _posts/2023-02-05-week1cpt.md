# Progress
I was able to take some steps forward on my CPT work. I was able to establish a frontend for my feature. I was also able to work on some of the backend API code.

I will need to take steps towards user input for the next week to ensure successful completion of my project.

# Challenges
I faced a few challenges this week. 
- I was trying to create the nix environment on the Flask for our backend. I was unable to test out the backend locally. 
- The error which I received was a 404 error because a link could not be found. I tried searching the web for solutions, but it usually meant that the certain site was down. I will check with my teacher soon in order to ensure a successful project.

# Next Steps
It is important to update the scrumboard and development chart with tasks we need to do and complete. 
- I will want to get the backend working, at least locally, so me and my team can test it out. 
- Next, I will also want to have code for implementation of getting the game onto the frontend. This will require Javascript coding. 
- Finally, I need to assist my team with work they help with.
