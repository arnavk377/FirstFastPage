# Scoring

I scored a 61/67 on this practice examination. That is a pretty good score. I should do my best to clean up mistakes for the next test.

## Mistakes

- 13: I did not realize there was an option to see the books not checked out in a year. There is no information about the total number of books in the database.
- 14: You are supposed to keep dividing number, so I forgot that it should be the quotient which is stored in it.
- 15: I thought this was similar to a past question, but I did not realize that i started at 1 for one program and 0 for the other, so this would result in the same values.
- 16: The program needs index minus 1 in order to be able to get to a level where it is less than 1, so it has to keep on being subtracted.
- 49: I did my math wrong. You need 2 to the 7th to store at least 100 values.
- 56: I missed that the procedure GetPrediction is used twice in version 2, so this is why it would take longer and about 5 more minutes, as there are 10 calls in 2 as compared to 5 calls in 1.
