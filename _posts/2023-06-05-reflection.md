# Reflection

Coming into this year, I didn't really know what to expect. I had heard a lot about CSP from my friends, but it looked really intimidating to learn these multiple languages. However, I was also excited because code is a very useful tool. I saw many amazing things created using code.

When first starting, it was a little bit hard. It could get frustrating trying to fix errors, but I learned to ask those around me for help. I would ask my peers, my parents, and my teachers for help with errors. Slowly, I learned more about my system and how it was organized. Through this, I learned a lot more about the different environments, like bash and python.

Through our group projects, I learned the importance of collaboration and organization. Using GitHub was really useful in keeping track of the work which was done. Our scrum meetings and review tickets helped me learn about being accountable for all my work and being able to describe my knowledge to my teacher. I also learned a lot, as I did a lot of work helping all of my peers and creating a successful project. These group projects introduced a real world focus which is hard to find in other classes. 

Throughout this year, I have learned a lot about coding. I developed a very solid understanding of coding languages. I also learned about things like the world wide web, and computer systems. I will definitely expand my knowledge about computer science in the future, as I work on my degree in Data Science. It will be interesting to write and use algorithms to find many patterns in the world. I will definitely need a better understanding of computer science, but I have a strong understanding thanks to CSP.
