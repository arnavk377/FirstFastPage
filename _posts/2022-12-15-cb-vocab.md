<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Bits</td>
<td>Smallest unit of computer information. The bit can either be on(1) or off(0)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bytes</td>
<td>Unit of computer information. Usually will feature 8 bits</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hexadecimal/Nibbles</td>
<td>Half of a byte, so this uses only 4 bits</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Binary Numbers</td>
<td>Represent with 0s and 1s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><mark>Unsigned Integer</mark></td>
<td>Does not have a plus or minus indicator in front of the value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Signed Integer</td>
<td>Has a plus or minus sign in front of a value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><mark>Floating Point</mark></td>
<td>Can be a positive or negative decimal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Binary Data Abstractions</td>
<td>Binary can be used to simplify the values of many things, from numbers, to whether a computer is on or off. Binary Data Abstraction makes it possible for computers to understand our inputs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Boolean</td>
<td>Variable which has a value of either True or False</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ASCII</td>
<td>American Standard Code for Information Interchange, encodes data for communication, allows a multitude of symbols to be represented</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unicode</td>
<td>System used to store and process text data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RGB</td>
<td>red, green, blue color model, can use data values to represent colors</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><mark>Data Compression</mark></td>
<td>reducing the number of bits to represent data, makes things cheaper</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lossy</td>
<td>a file which is removed or not restored after data compression has been reversed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lossless</td>
<td>when all files are restores or rebuilt after data compression has been reversed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Variable</td>
<td>Stores a value in a data set, there are multiple data types</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data Types</td>
<td>types of data, include string(letters/words), integers(numbers), boolean(T/F), float(decimals)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Assignment operators</td>
<td>operators which assign a variable a value, usually =</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lists</td>
<td>able to store multiple data points in one variable, can be iterated through</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2D Lists</td>
<td>lists which store multiple lists, can be used to represent matrices</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dictionaries</td>
<td>Similar to a list, except stores key value pairs which can be called</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Class</td>
<td>give blueprints for creating a data structure, store objects</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Algorithm</td>
<td>Sequences of code which allow certain tasks to be completed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sequence</td>
<td>The order in which a code is written</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Selection</td>
<td>Selecting a certain code segment, can be based on conditions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iteration</td>
<td>Going through a data set or repeating a step a certain number of times</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expression</td>
<td>combinations of statements</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Comparison Operators</td>
<td>Operators which compare two values, can be less than, equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Boolean Expressions and Selection</td>
<td>Boolean Expressions are expressions based on True or False conditions, selection of a sequence can result if a boolean expression is true or false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Boolean Expressions and Iteration</td>
<td>A sequence of code or list/dictionary can be iterated through if there is a certain condition met</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><mark>Truth Tables</mark></td>
<td>Tables which represent the results of operators like and, or, not, xor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Characters</td>
<td>the individual indices of a string</td>

<td>makes all letters of a string uppercase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lower</td>
<td>makes all letters of a string lowercase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traversing Strings</td>
<td>first character of string will be stored at 0, the 2nd character will be stored at 1, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Python If</td>
<td>will go through a code statement if a conditional is met</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Python Elif</td>
<td>will go through a code statement if a previous conditional is met, and a different one is</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Python Else Conditional</td>
<td>will go through a code statement if no conditional is met</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nested Conditional Statements</td>
<td>a selection statement inside of another statement, allows for more possible outcomes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Python For Loop</td>
<td>uses iterations, can iterate through a range or elements in a list</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>While loops with Range, with List</td>
<td>will go through a code segment as long as a certain condition is met, can help to iterate through a list</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue</td>
