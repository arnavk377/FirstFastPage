# Test Corrections

I will go over questions which I was confused on.

## Question 5
This question was using flow charts and asking about a company. This company was using a new system for their customer service claims.
- Question: Of the following potential benefits, which is LEAST likely to be provided by the upgraded system?
- Correct Answer: The company will be able to provide a human representative for any incoming call.
- My Answer: Customers are likely to spend less time listening to information not relevant to their issue.
My answer was incorrect because the system would allow the customer to talk to the phone and then get directed. The customer would be spending less time listening to irrelevant information for sure. The company would not be able to provide a human rep for every call because they could not give a human rep for calls outside of business hours.

I got this question wrong because I did not pay attention while reading the question.

## Question 34

Answer Choices, Correct vs Wrong

- Why my answer was wrong: Instead of rotating right after moving forward twice, I said that the robot would need to move left. 
I got this answer wrong because I was not paying proper attention. I did not realize the correct path for the robot. I can check my answers and visualize the path of the robot better.

## Question 35

I got this question wrong because I was not paying attention to the algorithm created. My wrong answer would select the top score of B if scoreC > scoreB > scoreA.

The correct answer checks every single score of the variables. This makes sure that every variable is checked.
