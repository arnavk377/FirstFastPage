# Example 1

| Reporting Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> Has a video showing program functionality, input, and output, Written response shows the program purpose of the project, Describes the functionality accurately, Details the inputs and outputs of the function |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | <mark>Has:</mark> There are 2 code segments, Has the name of the list of RPS, The written response states the name of a list <mark>Does not have:</mark> One code segment does not show the data being accessed from a list |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | <mark>Has:</mark> A list, Explains how to make the program without a list <mark>Does not have:</mark> The list does not manage complexity in the program, Does not define how lists are essential to the program |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | <mark>Has:</mark> A student developed procedure, Code segment relating to the student created procedure, Has a student created variable <mark>Does not have:</mark> Written response does not specifically state how the student developed parameter and variable are necessary to the function of the program |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration in a student developed algorithm, Thorough explanation of the algorithm which meets Collegeboard standards of being easy to recreate, Use if, else, and elif statements |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> Program takes in numerous arguments, Accurate descriptions of what each argument will result in, Different inputs are taken, Different outputs are received |
| Totals | 3 | 3 | |

# Example 2

| Reporting Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> Specific purpose of the program in written response, Video showing multiple inputs and outputs of the program, Accurately describes the outputs of the program |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> There are 2 code segments, Identified the list used, States what the list contains and it holds importance to the program |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> Written response includes how a list is used to manage the complexity in the program, Thoroughly explains how creating the  code would be much more complex and inefficient if a list was not used |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> There are 2 code segments in the written response, Student has a self created procedure as well as a student created parameter, Explains how the procedure works, Also explains why the procedure and parameter are essential to the program |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration in a student developed algorithm, There is a detailed explanation of the algorithm, The algorithm has an explanation which would allow it to be easily recreated |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> The program has multiple different calls to the program, The written response accurately writes how the calls will result in the program, There are different outputs shown by the video |
| Totals | 6 | 6 | |

# Example 3

| Reporting Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> The written response has a valuable purpose of the program, Video showing multiple inputs and outputs of the program, Accurately describes the outputs of the program |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | <mark>Has:</mark> There are 2 code segments, Identified the list used <mark>Does not have:</mark> The response does not accurately describe the purpose of the list in the code, There is no code segment which shows data being utilized from the list |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | <mark>Has:</mark> A code segment with the list <mark>Does not have:</mark> The response does not specifically state why it would be much harder to have code without the list |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | <mark>Has:</mark> There are 2 code segments in the written response, Student has a self created procedure <mark>Does not have:</mark> There is no student developed parameter, The explanation of the procedure does not show the functionality or provide an accurate description of the code |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | <mark>Has:</mark> The student created procedure has sequencing and selection<br> <mark>Does not have:</mark> There is no iteration in the code,  The written response does not have a description which would allow the code to be recreated, There are incomplete explanations of the procedure in the written response |
| Testing | 0 | 0 | <mark>Has:</mark> <br> <mark>Does not have:</mark> Does not have 2 unique calls to a procedure, There are not 2 separate conditions tested, Explains what will happen on the next screen, but does not have the output of the 2 separate calls, |
| Totals | 1 | 1 | |

# Example 4

| Reporting Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> The written response features what the program does accurately,
Video showing multiple inputs into the program, Shows output of the program, The program shows how the input affects the output of the function |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> 2 code segments, Shows how the list is being used and how data is accessed from it, Names the list, Response is accurate with what is stored in the list |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> A code segment with the list, Talks about what the list does, The explanation shows how the code could be written without a list |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | <mark>Has:</mark> There are 2 code segments in the written response, Student has a self created procedure, Talks about how the program will work thanks to the procedure |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | <mark>Has:</mark> The student created procedure has sequencing, selection, and iteration, There is a sound explanation of the procedure which would allow it to be recreated, Mentions how the sequencing, selection, and iteration are part of the program |
| Testing | 0 | 0 | <mark>Has:</mark> Describes the conditions which will be tested <br> <mark>Does not have:</mark> Does not talk about the results of the call, only talks about the code,  References to specific calls passed through the code |
| Totals | 5 | 5 | |

# Reflection
After reviewing the Collegeboard samples for 3 weeks, I have a better understanding of what goes into a successful Create Performance Task. It is important to look at the rubric, as it can offer the necessary guidance to a successful task. I will remember to <mark>keep the Collegeboard rubric handy while making my code.</mark> 

It will also be important to make sure that I am being correct when writing the written response. I will remember to double check my written response and keep accurate notes and documentation of my code to make the written response accurate and easy to create.
